<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>That interest in crime and the criminal is universal no
one will deny. In a cruder age it was the custom to
organize parties to witness the public execution of notable
scoundrels&mdash;Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton) took
Thackeray and, I believe, Dickens, to see Courvoisier's&mdash;but
nowadays we are more decorous, although on occasion
several thousand persons can assemble outside a
prison and stare at a blank wall during a private hanging
inside. Most of us, however, are content to behold crime
through the eyes of our favourite journal and it is
impossible to complain that the press does not cater fully
for us in this respect. That crime retains its fascination
for high and low is proved almost every time there is a
sensational trial at the Central Criminal Court, for the
attendance invariably includes distinguished politicians,
authors, artists and representatives of that nebulous
class termed "Society." It is, however, no longer
possible for a special box to be erected at the Old Bailey
to enable members of the Royal Family to watch a man
on trial for his life, and it is now bad form for a "popular
judge" to surround himself with princes and peers and
audibly keep them <i>au fait</i> with the evidence. These
things have passed away and we have "headlines" and
contents-bills in their place. We are, in fact, more
respectable if less robust, but sin and sinners will intrigue
us to the end of Time.</p>

<p>James Greenacre, was the subject of more than one
pamphlet biography, but I have preferred to go to the
copious reports of his trial for my material, and I consulted
similar sources whenever possible before writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
the chapters dealing with Marie Tarnowska, Mrs. Leroy
Chadwick, Jeanne Daniloff, three of my German criminals
and several others. Greenacre's trial and execution were
conducted on typical early nineteenth century lines,
and that loathsome scoundrel was nearly elevated to the
pinnacle of a hero by indiscriminate publicity. The competition
to be present in Court when he was in the dock
was so keen that a pound a head was charged for admission
to the gallery on each day and even at that price the
queue was always greater than the accommodation.
After his conviction he was visited in prison by scores of
"noblemen and gentlemen," and while in a contemporary
account of the execution&mdash;which I quote&mdash;the
reporter omits the names of those eminent persons who
attended it, it is significant that the number of private
carriages, according to another journalist, should have
exceeded fifty.</p>

<p>I obtained from an American detective who knew
Adam Worth many of the details of that rogue's doings,
and it is to an American newspaper of the late sixties
that I am indebted for particulars of Belle Star's career.
Marie Tarnowska told her own story to Madame A.
Vivanti Chartres, who sympathetically transferred the
countess's <i>apologia</i> to paper and published it. As a
human document it is very interesting but it is not
convincing, and the very full report of her trial at Venice
published in the press of this country is the only reliable
guide to an understanding of the case. M. Canler, the
famous French detective, first related in narrative form
the incidents which lead to the three arrests of the
murderers of Madame Houet, and I consulted the French
and English papers for the history of Pierre Voirbo's
crime. "Madame Rachel" was tried three times and
there were several special reports at the disposal of the
author, but she does not seem to have attracted much
notice since her death and an account of her life will be
new to most of my readers.</p>

<span class="subhead">A RUSSIAN DELILAH</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">One</span> day in a Russian country-house a girl of
sixteen was presented to three men&mdash;a prince,
a baron, and a count, and as she greeted them
with youthful enthusiasm and <i>camaraderie</i> she was quite
unconscious of the fact that each of the three had asked
her father for her hand.</p>

<p>In the land of the steppes, girls develop quickly, and
although Marie was very young in years she was a fully-matured
beauty, tall, with fine features, a beautiful
complexion, a divine voice, and enough charm for half
a dozen ordinary women.</p>

<p>No wonder the men were in love with her&mdash;she captured
all hearts with her beautiful face and her musical
voice&mdash;and when she had to be told of the proposals
her father informed her that she could choose between
the prince and the baron, for he disapproved of the
count.</p>

<p>"I should love to be a princess," Marie cried
romantically.</p>

<p>Old Count O'Rourke, a typical Russian nobleman,
who was descended from an Irish soldier, was gratified.</p>

<p>"I am happy to hear you say so," he exclaimed, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>A year later Marie eloped with the count, the one man
of the three she had been warned against.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a series of tragedies for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
extraordinary girl, who became an even more extraordinary
woman. Her father promptly closed his doors
against her once she was the Countess Tarnowska.
Marie declared that she did not care, adding that her
husband was the most perfect lover in the world and
she was the happiest wife that ever lived. But within
six months she had changed her mind.</p>

<p>"God help me!" she murmured to a consoling friend.
"I did not know there could be so much sorrow in the
world." For in that short time she had discovered
that Vassili Tarnowska was a libertine and that she
was only one of many women he had professed to love.</p>

<p>From that moment Marie became a different creature.
Always high-spirited and highly-strung, she only required
a feeling of injustice to influence her to take to
the path that leads to perdition.</p>

<p>Her husband neglected her, and she could not bear
to be alone. Other men flocked round her and talked
lyrically of her exquisite beauty. The neglected wife
eagerly welcomed these compliments. Of course she
and her husband, as members of the Russian aristocracy,
had to maintain outwardly an appearance of perfect
amity, but they were rapidly drifting apart, and tragedy
was hovering over them all the time.</p>

<p>What would have happened had Marie found a strong
and loving husband one can only conjecture. That
she was born with a "kink" in her brain is evident.
She has since confessed to that, and more than one
specialist has recorded that she inherited disease as
well as life from her parents and that she was not always
responsible for her actions. But it has to be admitted
that when she began to carve out a career for herself
independently of her husband and children she permitted
no scruple, no sense of honour, and no decency to interfere
with her in her mad pursuit of pleasure.</p>

<p>The first of her victims was her husband's brother.
Peter Tarnowska was a quiet, intellectual youth with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
a great reverence for womenfolk. He admired his
sister-in-law, and was under the impression that Vassili
was devoted to her. His amazement was, therefore,
all the greater when, happening to call unexpectedly,
he saw Marie with tear-stained eyes sitting in desolate
loneliness. As a result of that interview Peter Tarnowska
knew that he had found his ideal, but, of course,
he was too late. She was another man's, and that
man was his brother.</p>

<p>Vassili Tarnowska, who prided himself on his taste,
was in the habit of haunting night restaurants with
beauties of questionable antecedents, and he was presiding
at a banquet in a restaurant in Kieff when he
was startled to see his wife enter with a man. She was
beautifully dressed, and she looked so happy that he
thought her the loveliest woman there. The realization
made him jealous, and Tarnowska, who did not want
his wife until others showed their appreciation of her
beauty and wit, now came back to her, and at once was
the most jealous of husbands.</p>

<p>Had Marie been wise she would have seized the
opportunity to atone for the past and make her future
happiness certain. She had two pretty children, and
Tarnowska was evidently determined to do his duty
by them all, but the countess had already gone too far
to wish to withdraw. She had lovers; here a doctor,
there an officer of the Imperial Guard; and there was
always a flattering number of candidates for the honour
of escorting her to the theatre or restaurant. She was
convinced that respectability was synonymous with
dullness, and, accordingly, when the count expressed
his penitence and desired a reconciliation he was too
late. Marie had no room for him now in her overcrowded
heart.</p>

<p>They lived together, of course, and entertained on the
lavish scale which brought so many Russian families
to poverty in the pre-revolution period. Marie was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
most popular of hostesses, for she possessed that happy
faculty of making each of her guests feel that the entertainment
was got up solely in his or her honour.</p>

<p>Months of riotous pleasure passed. Vassili Tarnowska's
jealousy became a mania. He suspected every
man he saw in his home, and his wife's flippant and
contemptuous answers to his questions exasperated
him. The beauty found it impossible to forgive or forget
the fact that the husband she had once considered
the most chivalrous man in all the world had been the
only male to neglect her for other women.</p>

<p>They were at breakfast one morning when Tarnowska
was handed a telegram. Suddenly he leaned across the
table and screamed a question to her.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to my brother Peter?"
he cried.</p>

<p>Marie could not speak.</p>

<p>"Read that," said the count, as he thrust the telegram
into her shaking hand.</p>

<p>"Peter hanged himself last night." She read the
message aloud in a voice that grated on him. "He
was a foolish boy," she remarked indifferently. "I
had forgotten his existence."</p>

<p>The tragic fate of Peter Tarnowska was still being
talked about when Alexis Bozevsky became the lover
of the countess. He was the type of man who looks
and acts like the hero of a melodrama. He was tall,
with a superb figure, a moustache that seems to have
been irresistible, a <i>bonhomie</i> men and women were
hypnotized by, and he was, undoubtedly, a past master
in the art of pleasing romantically-minded ladies.</p>

<p>He penned a couple of letters to Marie, which won
her for him, body and soul. She ran the most terrible
risks on his behalf once she was in love with him, and
the woman who was a queen amongst men now gladly
became the slave of this handsome officer of the Imperial
Guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
The story of their love is brief and tragic and very
melodramatic. It is difficult to believe that it all
happened so recently as 1907. The jealous husband,
the handsome lover, the cigarette-smoking Russian
countess with the beautiful face and dark eyes&mdash;all
belong to the stage; yet the Tarnowskas and Alexis
Bozevsky were real personages, and two of them are
living to-day.</p>

<p>For some time Marie's latest conquest was unnoticed
by her husband, who hoped that his brother's suicide
would reform her. When he stumbled upon the truth
he simultaneously resolved to kill Bozevsky in a duel.
The first encounter between the jealous husband and
the handsome lover took place in the house of the former.
Tarnowska was armed, but he would not shoot a defenceless
foe, and he flung on the table a revolver for his enemy.</p>

<p>"We will settle it here," he said, with the laugh of
a madman.</p>

<p>Bozevsky was terrified by that laugh, and fled from
the apartment to tell Marie what had happened. They
agreed on a course of action, knowing that there was no
room in the world for both the count and the officer,
and they felt that they were helpless to avert the
approaching tragedy.</p>

<p>A few days later Count Tarnowska, very pale and very
self-possessed, entered the police station at Kieff.</p>

<p>"I have shot Alexis Bozevsky," he said calmly. "I
found him dining with my wife at the Grand Hotel.
I am your prisoner."</p>

<p>The astounded and agitated inspector did not detain
him. Tarnowska was of too high a rank, and, besides,
he suspected that the count was not quite right in his
head. But Tarnowska had spoken the truth. Bozevsky
was not dead, but he was dying, and Marie had left her
home and had deserted her children in order to nurse
him.</p>

<p>Bozevsky lingered for a few days, and Marie scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
ever left his side. She knew that never again would she
go back to her husband. The attack on Bozevsky outside
the Grand Hotel precluded that. She spent hours
praying for the recovery of the young officer whom she
passionately loved, and often he would lie with a wan
smile on his strained face whilst she pictured their
happy future together. At these interviews Dr. Stahl,
who was attending the wounded man, was always
present. He was pale and weak-looking, obviously the
victim of drugs, and Marie ignored him because she
knew that he was in love with her too!</p>

<p>For Stahl had introduced Marie to the mysteries of
drug-taking, to which she was now addicted. This
accounts for a lot. At her trial she was described as a
"human vampire," yet at times she had been the most
devoted of mothers and the most generous of friends.
But she lacked a brake to steady her when she began to
descend, and she went from one wickedness to another
until the final catastrophe.</p>

<p>When the young officer died Marie Tarnowska's heart
died too. She could never love again, and she never
did, but she could pretend to. In her desolation she
rushed off into the country; she travelled and tried to
forget. Her husband and her children were lost to
her; she had been told that she would never be allowed
to see them again. The sentence hardly affected
her, for she could not think of anything or anybody
now that the world was very lonely and her life
empty.</p>

<p>Hitherto Marie Tarnowska had never known what it
was to lack money. She had spent freely without any
thought of the morrow. She had no idea of the value
of money. In the past it had always been there for
her to take. But now that her husband no longer
acknowledged her existence her sources of supply were
cut off, and it was the soulless proprietor of a second-rate
hotel who drew her attention to the fact that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
beautiful countesses must pay their way or suffer the
humiliations attendant on poverty.</p>

<p>It was a bitter awakening. Marie Tarnowska became
terrified. She could not earn her living; she must beg
or borrow, or kill herself; and she had no desire to die.</p>

<p>She was walking to a telegraph office to send a message
to her father explaining her position and imploring him
to respond, when she heard her name pronounced by
some one behind her. Turning, she recognized Donat
Prilukoff, one of the wealthiest lawyers in Moscow.
He had been a visitor at her house in the days of her
glory, and Marie had been aware that he was in love
with her.</p>

<p>Prilukoff was rich! Marie recollected that too! She
had disliked him in the past, but she was poor now and
beggars cannot be choosers.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," she murmured, and tears came
into her fascinating eyes.</p>

<p>Prilukoff guessed how her affairs stood, and came
to the rescue, but she could not forget her antipathy
to the lawyer. A new passion had arisen in her, however,
a passion for money, and henceforth she meant
never to feel the want of it again, even if she had to
pretend to love Prilukoff.</p>

<p>They became inseparable, the Moscow lawyer and the
beautiful adventuress who had broken so many hearts
and her own life.</p>

<p>"What has become of Dr. Stahl?" Marie asked
shortly after their reunion.</p>

<p>Prilukoff laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>"He shot himself through the heart the other day,"
he said, in a callous tone. "They sent for me, and he
died with your name on his lips, Marie."</p>

<p>She was "Marie" now to the man she had christened
"The Scorpion" when she was rich and at the height
of her popularity.</p>

<p>Prilukoff, middle-aged and unromantic-looking, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
fiercely in love with the countess. At all their previous
meetings he had been thrust into the background by the
clever, handsome young men who had worshipped at
Marie Tarnowska's shrine, but now he had her to himself.
Every day she accepted money from him. Her
creditors having discovered her address, presented their
bills with unveiled threats.</p>

<p>Prilukoff saved the situation each time. He paid
out thousands of pounds, and Marie Tarnowska hated
him the more she was indebted to him. Had he ill-treated
her she might have showered kisses on his feet,
but he was recklessly generous, and she despised and
hated him. She was that sort of woman.</p>

<p>It was necessary, of course, that they should move
about, for it would have damaged Prilukoff's reputation
as a sound family lawyer whom elderly ladies could
trust with their investments if it was known that he was
supplying a notorious woman with funds.</p>

<p>Marie gladly went to Italy, leaving the lawyer to
attend to his business, but he was with her again within
seventy-two hours.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to let you out of my sight," he said.
"The business must take care of itself."</p>

<p>"But what about money?" asked Marie nervously.
It was all she thought of now. "I owe a thousand
pounds to my dressmaker, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Prilukoff produced a roll of notes.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said, "there is always plenty
to be had."</p>

<p>She was completely in Prilukoff's power when she
renewed her acquaintanceship with an old friend, Count
Paul Kamarowsky, a colonel in the Russian Army, and
a wealthy man. The count had just lost his wife, and
he was endeavouring to escape from loneliness by wandering
about Europe with his little daughter. Marie,
therefore, came into his life again at a very critical time,
and she had no difficulty in making him fall in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
her. He was ready to be tricked, and with Prilukoff's
help she proceeded to swindle him.</p>

<p>Marie had had no intention of obtaining money from
Kamarowsky until the Moscow lawyer had startled
and terrified her by confessing that he was practically
penniless. He had not only spent his means on her,
but he had stolen over forty thousand pounds from his
clients in order to satisfy her extravagant whims. When
Marie, regarding him with horror, suggested that he
should return to Moscow, he gripped her by the wrist.</p>

<p>"I've ruined myself for you," he cried hoarsely.
"Once I was the most respected lawyer in Moscow,
now I am a common thief, and if I return I shall be
arrested. Marie, you must be mine. I love you. I
have sacrificed everything for you. You must never
desert me. If you do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She saw the threat in his eyes, but did not hear his
words.</p>

<p>Events now followed one another in rapid succession.
Prilukoff had to be careful to keep out of the way of the
police, whilst Countess Tarnowska, who would have
given anything to be rid of him, had to see him every
day and discuss ways and means of obtaining supplies
of hard cash.</p>

<p>Prilukoff, who discerned that Kamarowsky was in
love with Marie, conceived a scheme by which they
eventually extracted a large sum from him. Scarcely
had the swindle been accomplished than Marie heard
that her husband had divorced her. She was free to
marry again, and she had already pledged her word to
the swindling lawyer to take his name, but Count Paul
Kamarowsky, rich, of noble family, and likely to make
a devoted husband, was going to propose to her!</p>

<p>The count did so that very night, and Marie accepted
him, extracting a promise that he would keep their
engagement a secret. She was terrified lest Prilukoff
should tell Paul that she was his, and so she played with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the two men, keeping them apart and persuading each
that he was the chosen bridegroom, though well aware
that she was in the power of Prilukoff and that she dare
not disobey him.</p>

<p>Marie was not in love. As I have said, her capacity
for love had ceased to exist with the death of Alexis
Bozevsky, but she wanted Kamarowsky's fortune, and
she would obtain it only by conspiring with Donat Prilukoff,
the dishonest lawyer, her master.</p>

<p>As though the situation was not sufficiently complicated,
a third lover now came on the scene. This was
Nicholas Naumoff, a youngster of twenty, the only son
of the governor of Orel. Nicholas and Kamarowsky
were devoted friends, and when the count introduced
him to Marie he succumbed on the spot to the
charmer.</p>

<p>With three lovers, one of whom held her in the hollow
of his hand, Marie Tarnowska had a breathlessly exciting
time. In the old days she would have enjoyed the
situation, but now she hungered and thirsted for gold,
and it was of money only that she thought whenever
she asked herself what she should do.</p>

<p>The lawyer from Moscow haunted her. How she
wished that he would die and leave her to marry the
rich Count Kamarowsky, the man who could take her
back into society and open the doors now closed to her!
Marriage with Prilukoff would mean the perpetuation
of her disgrace, and she would inevitably sink lower;
yet she dare not move without his permission, and whenever
he came to her she had to do his bidding.</p>

<p>It was a cruel trick of Fate's to put her in such a
position. Countess Tarnowska, who had once driven
men crazy by her capriciousness, the beauty who could
pick and choose her lovers&mdash;and did so&mdash;was now at the
beck and call of an ugly lawyer with an ugly record!
She shed bitter tears, and was only comforted when
Prilukoff whispered that there was a way of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Kamarowsky's fortune and never knowing again the
terrors of poverty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Paul Kamarowsky suggested that they
should prepare for their wedding. Marie, who only
dreamt of the time when she would be his, had to plead
for a postponement, knowing that if she fixed the date
Prilukoff would do something desperate. But despite
her dislike for the lawyer she complained to him
that Kamarowsky had not yet referred to financial
matters.</p>

<p>Prilukoff, confident that Marie could not escape his
clutches, propounded a plan whereby Kamarowsky
was to be induced to make his will in her favour and
also insure his life for £25,000 on her behalf. The trick
was simplicity itself.</p>

<p>Prilukoff allowed Marie to dine with Kamarowsky
in an hotel at Venice, where they were all staying, and
in the middle of the dinner a waiter handed the woman
a letter. Marie started and went crimson when she
read it, and her companion, insisting on seeing what
had disturbed his fiancée, read the note, which purported
to have been written by a well-known Russian prince
offering to settle his fortune on her and insure his life
for £25,000 if only she would return to Russia and marry
him. Prilukoff had, of course, written the letter, and
Marie Tarnowska acted her part so realistically that the
next day Kamarowsky's will and insurance on his life
were facts, and she was heiress to both!</p>

<p>But once Kamarowsky had appointed the Russian
beauty the sole inheritor of his property in the event
of his death the conspirators wasted no time arranging
for his murder. They both wanted his money badly.
Marie, realizing that she could never marry him without
Prilukoff's permission&mdash;a permission which would
never be granted&mdash;entered into the conspiracy with
a callousness and an abandon that were inhuman.
She was only twenty-seven, but she could plot in cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
blood to take the life of one who had been and was
extremely generous to her.</p>

<p>Of course Marie herself would not do the deed, and
Prilukoff, whose nerve had long since gone, was quite
incapable of actually killing anyone. He could arrange
the details and hand the knife or revolver to the selected
assassin, but beyond that he could not go.</p>

<p>However, they were thorough and remorseless plotters.
Kamarowsky was in their way. His death would make
Marie a rich woman and Prilukoff a rich man, because
then he could make her marry him. The count, therefore,
must be removed. But who was to kill him?
That was a question that was answered within a few
hours by the arrival of Nicholas Naumoff.</p>

<p>The young man found Marie in her hotel at Venice, and
there and then it flashed across her mind that he was
the very person to kill Kamarowsky and at one stroke
turn her poverty into riches, for Prilukoff having no
more clients to rob, Kamarowsky must be murdered.</p>

<p>She was too clever, of course, to take him into her
confidence, although Naumoff was so infatuated that
he would have obeyed any command she was pleased
to give him. But Marie Tarnowska had a wholesome
fear of the law, and, whilst she was willing to consign
her young friend to a living grave, she had not the
slightest desire to experience the discomforts of a prison
herself.</p>

<p>It turned out that Naumoff had called to ask her to
marry him. His proposal inwardly amused Marie, for
he was so young and she was so old&mdash;in experience.
But she listened gravely to him, and when he had finished
she kissed him on the forehead and whispered in a
voice broken with sobs that she had prayed for this day
and now that it had come she could not, dare not, aspire
to happiness because a certain man stood between
them and would prevent their marriage.</p>

<p>The ardent youth naturally demanded to know who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
it was who was driving her to madness. She answered
under pressure that he was Count Paul Kamarowsky,
Naumoff's dearest friend.</p>

<p>He was so surprised that he tried to persuade Marie
that she was mistaken. Somehow Naumoff had not
regarded Kamarowsky as an aspirant to her hand.
He was so old compared with him, and love was, in his
opinion, the prerogative of youth.</p>

<p>"Watch him," said Marie, who had been secretly
engaged to the count for some months, "and you will
be convinced that he persecutes me. I have to be
polite to him, but, Nicholas, dear, I should be happy if
I never saw him again."</p>

<p>Naumoff watched as bidden, and of course he saw
Kamarowsky wait attentively on the woman to whom
he was engaged. Quite innocent of the fact that he was
giving cause for offence to his young friend, Kamarowsky
seldom went out unaccompanied by Marie; and, when
he was not looking and Nicholas was near her, she
would make a little grimace of disgust to indicate that
the count's presence was distasteful to her.</p>

<p>Naumoff, who had again proposed to Marie and been
accepted, was nearly driven out of his mind by jealousy.
He had pledged his word of honour not to reveal his
engagement to Kamarowsky, who was also similarly
placed by a promise to the beauty. Only Prilukoff,
who remained in the background, knew the true state
of affairs, and he was too worried by fear of the police
to be able to enjoy the comedy.</p>

<p>But that comedy quickly developed into one of the
most amazing tragedies of modern times, for Naumoff,
hot-headed and irresponsible when under the influence
of the Russian Delilah, decided to kill the man Marie
described as her persecutor, the lover by whose death
she stood to gain a fortune.</p>

<p>It was in the month of September, 1907, that the
decision was come to. As soon as she heard it Marie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
found it convenient to take a trip to Vienna and wait
there for the tragedy which would give her Kamarowsky's
large fortune and enable her to collect £25,000
from the insurance companies. Prilukoff also vanished,
having arranged to return to Marie when she had entered
into her inheritance.</p>

<p>So that she might not be suspected of participation
in the crime the woman wrote a letter to the Chief of
Police at Venice, warning him that there was a feud
between Nicholas Naumoff and Paul Kamarowsky and
that in all probability they would have recourse to
fire-arms. Acting on this letter the police watched
Kamarowsky's apartments, and by a strange coincidence
arrested a man who came from them at the moment
Naumoff fired the shots which aroused the house. The
prisoner, however, was released when it was seen he
was not the person they wanted.</p>

<p>When Naumoff, mad with jealousy, called on Paul
one morning, the count warmly welcomed him, though
owing to the early hour he had to receive him in bed.
But the moment he saw Naumoff's expression he guessed
something was wrong. Before he could speak, however,
the young man drew his revolver and fired two shots
at close range into Kamarowsky's body. The injured
man managed to rise to his feet and ask why his dearest
friend had turned against him. Naumoff babbled out
something about Marie Tarnowska, and the count
understood.</p>

<p>"You have been fooled," he muttered, for he was
rapidly losing blood. "Ah, there is some one on the
stairs. Quick, I will help you to escape by the window.
Some day you will understand. Nicholas, I&mdash;I loved
you as a son. I never thought it would come to this.
Quick&mdash;this way."</p>

<p>Kamarowsky actually assisted his murderer to escape,
but Naumoff did not evade the police for long, and when
he was locked in a cell he knew that not only had Countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Marie Tarnowska been arrested, but that Prilukoff,
the swindler, was also in custody.</p>

<p>The count was taken at once to a hospital, and a
famous surgeon stitched up his wounds.</p>

<p>"He will live," he said. "No vital part has been
touched."</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Tarnowska tragedy was to
end in a trial for attempted murder only, but Fate was
relentless, for the chief surgeon who had pronounced
Kamarowsky's life to be safe suddenly went mad in
the hospital ward and ordered the stitches to be removed
from the healing wound. A few hours afterwards
Kamarowsky died in agony, and the last words of
his delirium were a message of love for Marie, the woman
who had planned his death and who had tricked his best
friend into committing the crime.</p>

<p>The three accomplices spent over two years in prison
before being arraigned, and the trial was a protracted
affair in spite of the fullest confessions by the prisoners.
Sensations were innumerable during the proceedings
and there were many emotional scenes, and on May 20th,
1910, the Venice jury brought in a verdict of guilty,
adding a rider to the effect that the countess and
Naumoff were suffering from partial mental decay.
Prilukoff was sentenced to ten years' solitary confinement;
Marie Tarnowska to eight years' and four months'
imprisonment, and Naumoff to three years and one
month, the time already spent in gaol to be included.</p>

<p>As for Marie Tarnowska, the beauty who had ruined
many lives, she went to her punishment as if in a trance.
All her scheming, all her heartlessness and greed only
brought her in the end to a convict's garb and years of
unceasing and humiliating labour. And from the cell
she passed to obscurity.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN INFAMOUS FEMALE POISONER</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Gesina</span> Gottfried was, as a girl, plump
and pretty, bright and pert, and the young
men of the town in Germany in which she
was born never let her know what loneliness meant.
She had, of course, numerous suitors; and, while the
social position of her parents was a poor one, she did
not hesitate to declare that she would only marry a
man likely to make money and give her the luxuries
for which she craved. This was regarded as a good
joke by her acquaintances, for in those days the status
of women in Germany was even lower than it is to-day,
and they were regarded, after they had lost their youth
and their looks, as on a level with the beasts of the
field&mdash;it was no uncommon sight to see women harnessed
to the plough&mdash;and they were expected to toil all day
long.</p>

<p>However, pretty Gesina was humoured, and, after
taking stock of all her lovers, her choice alighted upon
one named Miltenberg. He had a small business of
his own, was reputed to possess a considerable sum in
the savings bank, and bore the reputation of being
ambitious, and, therefore, certain to make more money.
Gesina's parents cordially approved of her decision,
and at the age of seventeen the girl became a wife.
Within three years she was the mother of two fine
children, and the small world in which the Miltenbergs
lived envied them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
But the truth was that the marriage had proved a
miserable fiasco. The young bride had not taken long
to discover that her husband was an improvident
drunkard, who was heavily in debt and who lived on
the verge of the gaol. Whenever she remonstrated he
treated her cruelly, and it was only Gesina's pride that
prevented her denouncing him. But she was compelled
to conceal her grief because she would not give her
jealous girl friends and former rivals an opportunity to
jeer at her, for she had boasted often that she was going
to be a lady and that when she was married she would
have a servant of her own. They had derided her then,
and she would not tell them now that she had made a
mistake in marrying Miltenberg, the drunkard and
wife-beater.</p>

<p>So the girl who had dreamed of being a lady and had
actually become a drudge was terrified every time she
heard her husband enter the house. Food was scarce,
but the cries of her children did not arouse a mother's
love. She turned upon them and exhausted her rage
by ill-treating them; yet Gesina was able to keep up
appearances and her parents did not guess the real
state of affairs.</p>

<p>About four years after her marriage Gesina paid a
visit to her mother. She found her engaged in a war
against the mice that were infesting the kitchen, her
principal weapon being white powder which she had
bought from the local chemist.</p>

<p>As Gesina sat and watched the bodies of the poisoned
mice it seemed to her a pity that brutal husbands could
not be as easily got rid of, and her thoughts dwelling
for a long time on this injustice she finally abstracted
some of the white powder when her mother was upstairs.</p>

<p>Gesina reached home that night with the precious
powder, half an hour before her husband returned from
one of the vilest cafés in the town. She was trembling
with excitement and her pale cheeks were now flushed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and she looked something like the girl Miltenberg had
married four years earlier. But he was too far gone
to notice anything, and beyond the customary threats
his only remark was to growl his appreciation of the
glass of beer with which Gesina unexpectedly presented
him. The beer was not yet poisoned, for Gesina had
decided to give him one more chance. It was, of course,
a hopeless one, as it was not possible that he would reform
unexpectedly and never strike her again.</p>

<p>The drunken boor was sitting at the table clutching
the glass when a knock came to the door, and a moment
later Gesina had admitted a mutual friend, Gottfried,
a young man who had shown for some time that he
admired her. Locked within the ill-used wife's breast
was the secret of her strange love for this weak youth,
and now the sight of him inflamed her, as she knew that
she had the means to free herself from the brute whose
name she bore. Gottfried's coming there that
night meant sentence of death on Miltenberg, and
without any compunction the woman dropped some
of the arsenic into his glass.</p>

<p>The doctor who attended Miltenberg during his brief
fatal illness was aware of the fellow's dissipated life,
and he readily certified that death was due to natural
causes.</p>

<p>Gesina was now in a position to marry Gottfried, and
there was yet a chance that she might be rich and
happy.</p>

<p>Without troubling about mourning she renewed her
acquaintance with Gottfried, who had by now, however,
grown tired of her. Perhaps he had read her character
that night he had called and sat beside Miltenberg
whilst the latter drank the poisoned beer. Perhaps he
had a suspicion of the truth, and was afraid lest he
should meet with the same fate. But the poisoner
ignored his coldness towards her. She had determined
to marry him, and marry her he must.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
She forced a proposal from him, and then an unexpected
obstacle arose in the opposition of her parents.
Gesina was astounded; Gottfried secretly delighted.
He was always docile and submissive when in her company,
but once he was out of her sight he hated her.
She was too self-willed and masterful for him, and he was
a genuinely happy man when he was informed that her
parents considered him too obscure and contemptible
to be worthy the honour of their daughter's hand.</p>

<p>In vain Gesina argued, implored and threatened.
The old people would not give way. They told her
that it was her duty to look after her children and not
bother about a second husband, and as they had the
law on their side Gesina would only fling herself out of
the house and return to her own squalid one to ponder
over her grievances.</p>

<p>A woman of her sort could come to only one decision,
and that was to send her father and mother to their
graves with the aid of the white powder which had
proved so effective in the case of her brutal husband.
She accordingly pretended to forget Gottfried, and
sought a reconciliation with her parents, who, to celebrate
the reunion, gave a pork supper in her honour.
Gesina, who was particularly fond of this favourite
dish, did full justice to it, although before sitting down
to the table she had put arsenic in the beer her parents
were to drink! When they were taken to their room in
agony she calmly continued to eat, and she was so
callous that when they died she shed no tears.</p>

<p>With three victims to her account Gesina went to see
Gottfried. He affected to be overjoyed at meeting her
again, and, fortified by the knowledge that the opposition
of her parents rendered a ceremony of marriage between
them impossible, spontaneously invited her to have
dinner with him. But Gesina took away his appetite
at the very beginning of the meal by informing him that
her parents had suddenly died, and that there was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
no reason why he should not fulfil his promise and make
her his wife.</p>

<p>Gottfried went pale with terror, and so great was his
agitation that she noticed it at once, and taxed him with
trying to deceive her. The unhappy coward protested
that she was doing him an injustice.</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear of their death," he stammered,
perspiration breaking out on his forehead. "I had a
great respect for them, and your tragic news has upset
me."</p>

<p>Gesina laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Considering that they always treated you like dirt,
you needn't wear mourning for them," she retorted.
"Don't be a fool, Hermann. All I want to know is
when we can be married? I'm tired of living
alone."</p>

<p>The last sentence put an idea into his head. It reminded
him that she had two children. In faltering
tones he suggested that it would be inadvisable to marry.
He swore that he had nothing saved, and that it would be
too heavy a burden for him to provide for a wife who
would bring with her another man's two children.</p>

<p>If Gesina had not been satisfied that she had the
means of removing everybody who stood in her way
she would have been extremely angry with Gottfried,
but now she only became pensive, and a little later proceeded
to discuss his objection in detail.</p>

<p>"You don't object to me, I suppose?" she asked,
holding her clasped hands under her chin.</p>

<p>He protested with many oaths that he loved her to
distraction, but that the children were so many barriers
to their marriage because he was really poor.</p>

<p>"Very well," she observed, before changing the subject,
"I will wait until the children are not a burden to
anybody."</p>

<p>A fortnight later she met him again.</p>

<p>"My children are dead," she said simply. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
had convulsions a week ago, and quickly passed away.
I am now quite alone in the world."</p>

<p>The man regarded her with horror. It is most likely
that he was the only person who suspected that these
unexplained deaths were no mysteries to her. But he
could not have thought for a moment that she was a
fivefold murderess!</p>

<p>Gottfried was an ignorant and superstitious man, and
he knew nothing about poisons. All the deaths caused
by Gesina's "white powder" had been duly certified by
respectable local practitioners, and he had not the courage
to create a scandal by voicing his suspicions regarding
the two children.</p>

<p>There was something fascinating about Gesina, and
Gottfried's will power always vanished when he was
with her. But nevertheless, he made a brave struggle
to resist her, and, although he agreed to an engagement,
he never had the slightest intention of becoming her
husband.</p>

<p>Gesina pretended to be satisfied with his promise, and
even when, as the occasion arose, he put forward the
flimsiest of excuses to postpone the ceremony, she was
ever contented and apparently happy. A few months
went by, and there were no more sudden deaths among
her relatives. Gottfried's fears left him and he began
to think of her as he had in the days when she was a
young bride.</p>

<p>Yet he stopped short at marriage, and beyond an
engagement would not go. As the young woman very
seldom referred to the former he was very pleased to take
her to the cafés and to the theatres, and generally have
a good time in her society. But he totally misunderstood
the character of the creature who called herself
his sweetheart. Gesina was content because she had
already devised a method by which she knew that she
would accomplish her object. She had not poisoned
five human beings without learning a lot, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
now an expert. She knew exactly how to kill and how to
cause an illness without fatal results, and she decided
to dose Gottfried until she had so weakened him in body
and mind that he would be mentally as well as physically
at her mercy.</p>

<p>The infatuated fool never suspected anything, and
when his mysterious illness began he did not draw any
inferences from the fact that Gesina often sat by his
side while he was drinking. Of course the vile creature
had used every opportunity to administer arsenic in
small quantities, and she had many, because she insisted
upon nursing him.</p>

<p>It was a most scientific and crafty murder, because as
Gottfried grew weaker he got more affectionate, and she
gave him the poison so cleverly, and worked upon his
feelings so astutely, that he came to regard her as his
devoted nurse! He would allow no one else to come near
him or give him his medicine, and every day his passion
for her increased, and he shed tears when she was not
with him. Gesina, after coaxing him to take poisoned
soup, would sit by his bed and cheer him by painting their
future together in rosy colours. She would not hear
of a fatal issue to his illness, and what with her gaiety and
her optimism the patient thought her an angel.</p>

<p>But despite her "nursing" he grew worse every day,
until it was obvious that he was going to die. By this
time he was too weak to be able to think of anything
except his love for Gesina, and at last he asked her as a
favour to marry him on his death-bed.</p>

<p>Within an hour of his proposal, Gesina, dressed in
black, called upon a clergyman, and told a heart-rending
story of a dying lover who had implored her to ease his
last hours by consenting to be his wife. The minister
of religion was touched, and instantly agreed to marry
them. He repaired at once to the death-chamber, and
there the dying man and the murderess joined hands
and were made man and wife. Within twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
hours, however, Gesina was a widow again, for Gottfried
passed away as the result of an extra strong dose which
she administered twenty minutes after she had become
Frau Gottfried.</p>

<p>She did not lose anything by the marriage even if she
did not gain much. Gottfried left a few hundred pounds,
and to this sum she succeeded. Her principal motive
for marrying him was vanity. So many persons had
talked sneeringly of her long engagement to Gottfried
that Gesina knew it would surprise and mortify the
gossipers if she did really become his wife, and to gratify
this whim she slowly poisoned him!</p>

<p>But her successes were so numerous, that she took to
poisoning people as a hobby. The "white powder"
was her infallible remedy for removing objectionable
men and women. She did not fear the doctors, and she
laughed at their ignorance. Most of them were quacks,
and none of them were a match for the quick-witted
woman, who seemed to flourish on murder. She might
dwell in an atmosphere of death, yet there were always
men to court her, and the good-looking widow had
several proposals.</p>

<p>The third opportunity to marry, which she decided to
accept, came from a prosperous merchant, who was
fascinated by the young face and the glib tongue of the
poisoner. He met Gesina for the first time at Gottfried's
funeral, and he had accompanied her home with a
few other friends to comfort her, and after that he
frequently called, until it was obvious that Gesina liked
him. That unlucky merchant was, however, indirectly
responsible for one of Gesina's most brutal crimes ere
he, too, fell a victim to her devilish arts.</p>

<p>One night the merchant was chatting with the widow,
when a tall, stout soldier staggered into the room the
worse for drink. Gesina and the merchant started to
their feet, and the latter would have turned upon the
drunkard had not the woman recognized her brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
whom she had not seen for years. During those years
Wilhelm had not improved; he was, in fact, after the
stamp of her first husband, Miltenberg, a drunkard and
a bully, and he now insisted upon being made welcome,
behaved rudely, insulted Gesina's lover, and was only
pacified by offerings of unlimited beer. When he had
drunk sufficient he announced his intention of remaining
in the house, and there was every reason to suspect that
he intended to cadge and bully her out of her small
means before taking his departure.</p>

<p>But the "white powder" solved the problem. Gesina
woke him up in the middle of the night with a glass of
beer in her hand, which he delightedly drank, and
thanked her with brotherly affection. At nine o'clock
he was a corpse, and when Gesina knocked on his door
and called out the time she received no answer. She
had not expected one.</p>

<p>The merchant, who had been thoroughly disgusted
with the soldier's behaviour, could scarcely express
conventional regret when he heard the news, and he
gained Gesina's gratitude by paying the funeral expenses.
Out of gratitude Gesina fixed the date for their
marriage, but a week before the ceremony was to be
performed her lover fell ill.</p>

<p>His days on earth were now numbered. Gesina,
averse to becoming his wife, had poisoned him, but in the
same way as she had done Gottfried. She dosed him
into a state of utter helplessness, and when he was prostrate
she induced him to make a will in her favour. This
was the day before he died. The doctor was never even
suspicious, and her lover was buried. Then she retained
a clever lawyer to collect his effects, turn them into hard
cash, and remit the money to her. A few relatives
protested, but Gesina and the lawyer settled them, and
the murderess entered with intense satisfaction into
possession of three thousand pounds, a large sum to her.</p>

<p>A year subsequent to this crime she was again engaged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and once more she slowly poisoned her fiancé and he made
her his heir. When his will had been drawn up she
administered the final dose, and, having allowed a few
days to elapse, proceeded to inquire into the extent of
her inheritance.</p>

<p>Greatly to her anger and astonishment, she discovered
that she had been hoaxed. Her victim had left nothing
except debts, and she had wasted valuable arsenic upon
him. To add insult to injury, rumours spread that
Gesina had inherited a large fortune, and several persons
who had lent her money began to press for repayment.</p>

<p>Besides being a murderess, Gesina was very mean.
She could borrow from the poorest of her acquaintances,
but she would not repay them even when she had a considerable
amount to her credit. She loved money, and
nothing pleased her better than to add to her store of
gold coins. She was in the habit of carrying five hundred
pounds about with her in notes and gold, and she gradually
acquired a collection of jewellery.</p>

<p>It is difficult to write of her as a human being. One
can hardly imagine that she ever existed, and yet all the
details of her career I have given are on the official records
of the German Criminal Courts.</p>

<p>Gesina with the blue eyes and the merry laugh went
through life scattering death on each side of her. She
could crack a joke with a man who was dying at her
hands. She could dress in black and shed tears over a
coffin, and at the same time debate with herself as to her
next victim. She poisoned innocent and inoffensive
persons just to keep her hand in. When she had over a
thousand pounds she murdered a woman because she had
asked for the return of a loan of five pounds.</p>

<p>The last-named affair occurred after the murder of the
lover who had tricked her in death. Gesina's friend lived
in Hamburg, and, having fallen upon evil times, and
hearing that her old acquaintance was now a rich widow,
she wrote asking to be repaid the money she had lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
her. Gesina sent an affectionate letter in return, inviting
Katrine to visit her, when she would not only pay her
the debt, but add a present for her past kindness. It is
only necessary for me to add that Katrine never returned
to Hamburg for my readers to realize what happened to
her when she became Gesina's guest.</p>

<p>But on account of her numerous crimes Gesina was
compelled to change her residence frequently, and when
she bought a house in Bremen it was the sixth German
town in which she had settled.</p>

<p>The house she took was capable of accommodating
several families, and she considered it a safe investment
for her "earnings." But somehow things went wrong.
She was an expert poisoner, but she was not good at
business, and eventually she had to raise a mortgage
on her property at a ruinous rate of interest.</p>

<p>Gesina's ambition had always been to appear better
off than her neighbours, and now, in order to gratify her
vanity, she forgot her old passion for hoarding money.
She lived luxuriously and dressed well, and, realizing
that her mind was beginning to be reflected in her face,
she took to paint and powder to conceal her true character.
Youth had fled from her, although she was young
in years. She was thin, scraggy, and unpleasing to the
eye, but Gesina acquired the art of making up, and she
was able to pose as a young-looking widow who had
known sorrow without having been hardened by it.</p>

<p>For two years she played her part so well that she
escaped detection. The "pretty widow" became a well-known
character in Bremen, and it was often rumoured
that she was about to be married again. But somehow
an accident always happened at the critical moment.
Either it was the wrong man, and then Gesina simply
poisoned him, or else the right man became uneasy and
backed out of the engagement, and the murderess felt
that she dare not protest too much lest she should expose
herself and her past to inquiry. Anyhow, she was still a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
widow when the mortgagees foreclosed and took possession
of her apartment house.</p>

<p>Gesina was now really poor. All her savings had gone,
and with them her credit. She was actually in danger of
starvation, and her condition was so forlorn that when the
new owner of the house&mdash;he had purchased it from the
mortgagees&mdash;came to turn her out and install his own
family, he was so touched by her distress&mdash;and she looked
so pathetically pretty as she sobbed in the darkened
room&mdash;that he gave her the position of his housekeeper.</p>

<p>Herr Rumf was one of the most respected tradesmen
in Bremen. A master wheelwright, he employed several
hands, and was considered a generous employer. His
wife and children adored him, and he was just the sort
of man to be affected by a forlorn widow's grief, for he
was large-hearted and easily roused to deeds of
generosity.</p>

<p>Gesina was not long in Rumf's employment before she
planned out a regular campaign of murder. She resolved
to murder her employer's wife, and thus regain her ownership
of the house, in addition to becoming the mistress
of his fortune, for once she was his wife she meant to
dispose of him as she had Gottfried and the infatuated
merchant. As for Rumf, he unconsciously became a
willing party to the plot. His own wife, aged by the
cares of a large family, was not exactly an exhilarating
companion, and he was charmed of an evening on his
return from his shop by Gesina's ready wit and her
stories of fashionable persons she pretended to have
known when she was better off.</p>

<p>When Frau Rumf gave birth to a child it was Gesina
who attended her, and who at night waited on Rumf, and
banished his melancholia. He, too, began to cherish
dangerous thoughts, and when his wife's illness took a
turn for the worse, following the unexpected death of her
infant, he was not nearly as distressed as he would have
been had he never made the acquaintance of the widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
who had "come down in the world," as she often assured
him.</p>

<p>The unfortunate wife died, and Gesina was given the
charge of the five little children. Herr Rumf could not
neglect his business. It was of far more importance
to him than his family; and, while he observed all the
conventions in mourning for his wife, he was too good a
German to allow her decease to interfere with money-making.
Gesina, therefore, reigned over his household;
and, recalling what Gottfried had said about children
being an obstacle to matrimony, she poisoned all five in
the most fiendishly cruel manner.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is that Rumf never suspected that
the seven tragedies in his household were not mere
accidents of fortune. He was suspected of aiding and
abetting the murderess, but as he very nearly became one
of her victims he was not prosecuted, especially as he
actually brought her career to an end.</p>

<p>His last child had just been interred when Herr Rumf
himself had a breakdown. For some days he had found
it impossible to retain food, and he was wasting away,
when he ordered one of the pigs he kept to be killed and a
portion of the meat cooked for him. As Gesina was then
visiting some friends the meal was prepared by a servant,
and to Rumf's extreme delight he found that it agreed
with him. It was the first food he had eaten for a fortnight
that he was able to digest.</p>

<p>Pleased at the discovery, he had a goodly piece of the
pig placed in the larder for future use, being determined
to live on pork until he found something else to agree
with him. Nearly every day he took a look at the meat,
just to see that it was all right, and it was only by accident
that Gesina did not get to know of this. Rumf had
forgotten to tell her of his wonderful discovery, and
when she came across the spare rib of pork in the larder
she guessed who it was for, without realizing all that it
meant to Rumf, and decided that it would provide a safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
medium for administering another dose of arsenic to him.
She accordingly sprinkled it with the white powder, not
knowing how affectionately her employer regarded that
particular piece of meat, and ignorant of the fact that he
scarcely thought of anything else from morning until
night.</p>

<p>One day Rumf came home earlier than he was expected.
Gesina was gossiping with a neighbour, and did
not see him enter the house. The wheelwright went to
the larder to have a peep at his beloved pork, and he
noticed immediately that it had been shifted. He picked
it up to replace it, and then he saw the white powder.
At once he remembered having seen similar powder
before. It was in a salad which Gesina had prepared
for him just before the beginning of his illness.</p>

<p>Without scarcely pausing to think, he wrapped the
meat up in a cloth, and carried it to the police, who had it
examined.</p>

<p>When the doctor reported that the white powder was
arsenic Gesina was arrested. She instantly confessed
in the most brazen-faced manner, recounting her exploits
from the day she had murdered her first husband
down to the attempt on Rumf's life, and, knowing that
she would be shown no mercy, she reviled her gaolers,
and defied them to do their worst.</p>

<p>Her trial and condemnation in 1828 followed as a
matter of course, but Gesina went to her death with a
mincing gait, and a sneer for mankind in general. She
expressed only one regret, and that was that the notoriety
her evil deeds had earned for her had resulted in the
public becoming aware that her teeth were false!</p>

<span class="subhead">BELLE STAR, THE GIRL BUSHRANGER</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the American Civil War came to an end
it set free from discipline thousands of
rough, lawless men, many of whom subsequently
adopted crime as a profession. Amongst them
was the father of Belle Star. He was a tall, powerfully-built
man, with rugged features and gorilla-like arms,
a crack shot and a fearless horseman, and during the
four years Star had fought on behalf of the Southern
against the Northern States he had revelled in the
conflict. Peace had no charms for him, and when the
rival parties settled their differences he decided to make
war on both. In other words, he took to the bush with
half a dozen tried and trusted comrades, and for several
years the gang, which steadily grew in numbers, terrorised
the country-side.</p>

<p>Belle, his only child, was born near a battlefield and
within sound of the booming of the guns. The mother
did not long survive her birth, but, although nearly
always on the march, Belle was well looked after. She
was a pretty, fairy-like child, with blue eyes and an
engaging manner, and she was the pet of the camp.
The Southern soldiers called her their mascot, and
before she was five she could handle a pistol, and by the
time she was ten she was expert in the use of the lasso,
carbine, bowie knife, and revolver.</p>

<p>When Star turned bushranger Belle was only twelve,
but she was already well qualified to be a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
member of his gang. Only her father excelled her as a
shot, and in horsemanship she was without a rival.
Wild and apparently untamable steeds that Star himself
dare not mount became docile as soon as Belle took them
in hand. Animals loved her; men feared and respected
her.</p>

<p>She grew into a beauty, slim and fragile-looking, yet
in reality very strong, intelligent, audacious and clever.
When she was only fifteen she was once left in charge
of the headquarters of the outlaws for a whole day whilst
they rode to a certain town and held up the bank.
During their absence a tramp attempted to rob the camp,
but although he took Belle by surprise she soon had him
on the defensive, and instead of killing her she killed him
with her small white hands, slowly forcing the thief
backwards with her hands around his throat; then down
on his knees, and, finally, left him a corpse at her feet.
On the return of the outlaws she told her father what had
happened, and he there and then named Belle as his
successor in the leadership of the gang, and every man
present swore to obey her when her turn came to reign
over them.</p>

<p>Reared amid bloodshed, taught every day to regard
human life as anything but sacred, and educated to believe
that it was no sin to rob, it is not astonishing that
at the age of eighteen Belle, for all her beauty, was a
thorough-paced criminal. She had already shot down
at least half a dozen men; like her father she feared
nothing, and flying along on a swift horse she was
capable of hitting any human target within sight.</p>

<p>More than once her marksmanship had saved the gang
from being surrounded and overpowered, and during the
last two years of her father's life it was really her brain
that guided the band of outlaws.</p>

<p>But the inevitable day came when Star, the terror of
Texas, was slain in a running fight, and Belle succeeded
to the vacant leadership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Only those who knew what she really was could have
taken her seriously in her new capacity. She was eighteen,
with refined, delicate features, lovely blue eyes, a
pair of rosy lips, and a slim figure. By now the gang
consisted of twenty men, all veterans in vice and crime,
big, brawny, evil and coarse. Not one of them would
have hesitated to cut the throat of his own mother, yet
Belle during her reign held them in the hollow of her
hand.</p>

<p>They never dared to disobey her. There was never
any talk of mutiny, as there had been in her father's
lifetime, and animated by this perfect loyalty the gang
went on from success to success, and Belle Star, the
greatest of all female bushrangers, kept in subjection
scores of villages and towns.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the bloodthirsty spitfire was
to "avenge," as she called it, the death of her father.
Star had sent to their last account at least forty men and
women, but Belle would have it that his death had been
undeserved, and that because he had never robbed the
very poor the Sheriff had no right to shoot him for trying
to evade arrest. So she marked down the Sheriff for
execution, and with six of her followers set out for the
lonely farm belonging to the county official.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she knew that the Sheriff was
keeping a sharp watch for her, Belle did not hesitate to
wreak vengeance on him. It was in the early hours of a
June morning that she and her six followers rode out of
the camp, and for five hours they travelled, only stopping
when within half a mile of the Sheriff's residence. Then
they dismounted, carefully tethered their horses in a
wood, and did the remainder of the journey on foot,
Belle leading the way, revolver in hand.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, and as the Sheriff inspected his
farm workers, a score of sturdy men devoted to his interests,
he could hardly have suspected danger. He
was fully protected and well armed in case of attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and, feeling secure, he wandered aimlessly towards the
most remote corners of his property. He was idly
sauntering in the direction of a tool-shed, when two
men sprang at him, and before he could utter a sound
had him on his back, gagged and bound.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the Sheriff was led before Belle
Star, who was standing under an old tree waiting for him.
There was very little beauty in her face now. Her eyes
shone like a tigress', and her small white hands were
clenched.</p>

<p>Belle was smelling blood and gloating in the coming
murder of the man who had executed justice upon her
father.</p>

<p>The outlaw chieftainess called it a "trial," but the
Sheriff was doomed from the first. As they were out of
earshot she allowed the gag to be removed from his
mouth, and then he was mockingly asked if he could suggest
any reason why he should not be suspended from the
tree under which they had assembled.</p>

<p>The Sheriff was a brave man, and he knew that his
fate was sealed. He did not, therefore, make any plea
for mercy, but in the curtest tones told Belle that he was
merely one more victim of hers, but that in time his
murder would be avenged. He was proceeding to taunt
her with her disgraceful life, when she flushed angrily,
and ordered him to be strung up.</p>

<p>Her commands were obeyed, and Belle's last act was to
scribble on a piece of paper, "Executed by Belle Star,"
and pin it to his coat, before she rode away with her six
ruffians.</p>

<p>The murder of the Sheriff aroused the country, and
it seemed that Belle's career must be a short one.
Rewards were offered for her death or capture amounting
to more than ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>All classes organized to hunt down the notorious female
criminal. Respectable citizens enrolled themselves as
patrols to guard their homes, and for miles around there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
was not a town or village without its special defence.
But Belle had her own system of obtaining information,
and she learnt early all about the preparations that were
being made to capture her, laughing and derisively
boasting that she would outwit all her foes.</p>

<p>It was her fearlessness and audacity allied to success
that held the gang in subjection. Belle could do no
wrong. When any of them attempted a job on their
own account they invariably failed. Thus when Belle
injured her arm, and had to travel two hundred miles
disguised in order to see a doctor, four of her followers
thought they would rob a jewellery establishment and
keep the "swag" for themselves. They found courage
in drink, and proceeded to attack the shop, but everything
went wrong from the start. They were surprised
by a patrol, and a fight ensued, in the course of which
two of them were shot dead. The others escaped, and
reached the camp in an exhausted condition, and when
Belle returned she punished them by making them
do all the dirty work of the camp for a month, and fined
the discomfited scoundrels by refusing to allow them to
participate in the results of the next expedition.</p>

<p>That a young girl could dominate a gang of bloodthirsty
ruffians in this manner would be incredible if
the story of Belle Star's life was not fully authenticated.</p>

<p>With her usual cunning Belle waited until the enthusiasm
of the numerous Defence Committees was
cooled by inaction before resuming hostilities. For
several weeks nothing was seen of her gang, and rumours
began to circulate that she had fled with her followers
to a less highly organized district, having realized that
the good people of Texas were too clever for her.</p>

<p>Disguised as a man, Belle would visit various towns,
and in the market places and hotels listen to legends
about herself. She would laugh the loudest when the
leading citizens eloquently depicted her fate if they got
her into their hands. She had a sense of humour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
she could stroll into a local Court and watch petty
thieves being sentenced, and applaud moral sentiments
uttered by the presiding judge, who could not know that
the notorious female bushranger was sitting a few feet
away from him!</p>

<p>But her greatest exploit, apart from her many crimes,
was the winning of two races on the same day in full
view of thousands of spectators. It happened that a
town which had often suffered from her depredations
decided to hold a special race meeting, and amongst
several prizes two large sums of money were offered to
the winners of two particular races, one being for male
and the other for female jockeys.</p>

<p>Belle, realising that she was an expert rider, determined
to enter for both events, and as the one for men
took place an hour before that for the ladies, she assumed
male attire, and as a handsome young man rode
on to the racecourse. After giving a false name she was
permitted to take her place at the post, and as her horse
was the fleetest, and she was the most skilful jockey,
victory followed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>She received the stakes from the local mayor, made a
speech of thanks, and then retired. When she reappeared
she was dressed as a country girl, and this time
she was leading another horse.</p>

<p>She looked so simple and sweet that the stewards were
only too delighted to accept her entry for the race for
female jockeys, and loud was the applause when the
young beauty came in an easy first. Once more Belle
attended before the élite of the town to receive a considerable
sum of money, and she was cheered to the
echo by the huge crowd, amongst whom there were hundreds
of men who had sworn to capture Belle Star alive
or dead.</p>

<p>The funds proved very useful to the gang, but, better
than that, the men were so surprised and delighted by
her double exploit that they became more slavish in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
their devotion to her. Belle was supreme. She knew
now that if she led them into the very jaws of hell they
would not draw back or complain.</p>

<p>Owing to her father's depredations having created a
reign of terror amongst the country banks, a rule had
been made requiring all cashiers to keep a fully loaded
revolver on their desks, whilst if any suspicious stranger
entered the premises one of the other clerks was to cover
him unostentatiously with a revolver, and shoot at the
first sign of danger. This innovation having reduced
considerably the number of bank "hold-ups," it created
a belief that it had succeeded in frightening away Belle
Star's gang, but Belle proved that that was a great
mistake.</p>

<p>Adopting her usual disguise of a young farmer, Belle
went alone to Galveston to pick up gossip, and she was
fortunate enough to overhear at one of the principal
hotels a conversation between two merchants which revealed
the interesting fact that a week later the National
Bank was due to receive a consignment in gold amounting
to one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>That was the sort of thing that fired Belle's imagination,
and although she knew that the National Bank
was well guarded, and that the manager and cashier
transacted business fully armed, she resolved to capture
that consignment of gold.</p>

<p>She returned to her headquarters to give final instructions
to her followers, and then she went back to
Galveston, but this time she had assumed the character
of a little old woman with a thin voice and a hesitating
manner. She "fluttered" in the approved fashion of
nervous old ladies, and more than one polite citizen of
Galveston hastened to help her across the road when
they saw her shrinking from lumbering cart horses.</p>

<p>It was exactly ten minutes before closing time when
Belle timidly entered the National Bank and presented
a cheque, which she asked the cashier to change for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
She looked so pathetic in her black clothes, and was so
apologetic and yet friendly, that the cashier felt quite
sorry when he had to tell her that he could not oblige
her for the simple reason that the cheque was drawn on
the bank's branch at Austin, the capital of Texas. Perhaps
some of his politeness was inspired by a glance at the
signature on the cheque, which was that of a well-known
United States diplomat.</p>

<p>The poor old lady looked greatly distressed, and when
at last she fully understood that she was not to have the
money she showed signs of collapsing. The cashier
and one of the clerks hastened to come to her assistance,
and they assisted her into the manager's office, where she
sank on to a chair, and huskily whispered that she would
be all right in a few moments.</p>

<p>Manager, cashier and clerk were glancing at one
another when they were startled to hear the command&mdash;"Hands
up!" The next moment the "little old
lady" was covering them with her revolver, whilst
six of the outlaws under her command entered the building,
closed the door of the bank, and made all the officials
prisoners. Then they visited the vaults and the
strong-room, and, having waited until darkness had
fallen, took the gold out and packed it in the van
brought for the purpose, eventually riding away
leisurely.</p>

<p>It was not until the early hours of the following
morning that the trussed-up and gagged bank staff were
discovered and released. By then Belle Star was far
away, and for the next two days the gang were busy
changing their quarters in case they had been tracked
to their camp. This single exploit made them all rich,
but, of course, there was no limit to their greed, and no
sooner was it accomplished than Belle began to plan
others equally daring.</p>

<p>But she had a woman's vanity, and she brooded over
insults and taunts which a man would have ignored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and she sometimes risked her own safety and that of her
followers to avenge a petty slight.</p>

<p>She once happened to be in a populous town near
Austin, when she heard the local judge declare that he
knew Belle Star by sight and that he would shortly
arrest her, and have her publicly whipped before handing
her over to the Lynchers. The girl brigand and
the judge were actually seated next to one another
at the table d'hôte dinner at the hotel when he said
this.</p>

<p>Belle smiled at his delusion, but when he proceeded to
speak of her in opprobrious terms and gave her credit for
more crimes than murder and robbery her anger nearly
led her into revealing her identity. But she maintained
control of herself, and after a little reflection decided to
wait until the following morning before punishing the
boastful judge.</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast&mdash;she had registered as
a man, and, of course wore male clothes&mdash;she mounted
her horse in front of the hotel, and then sent a servant
to tell the judge that a stranger wished to speak to him.
At this time of day everybody was at work, and the
hotel staff were busy indoors and in the stables. When
the judge appeared he and Belle were practically alone,
as she knew, and without hesitating she blandly informed
him that she was Belle Star, and then raised her
whip and lashed him in the face.</p>

<p>The judge was so astounded that he was unable to
escape her until she had lacerated him considerably,
and, half blind and smarting from pain, his shrieks
for help were unanswered until Belle had reached a place
of safety.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that when a woman deliberately
embraces crime as a profession she is generally more
brutal and merciless than the average male criminal.
It was so with Belle Star. The fair-haired girl with the
sunny smile and the lovely lips could in cold blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
sentence to death a young man whose only offence was
that he had tried to defend his property and his life.</p>

<p>Belle, too, was in the habit of accepting her own
suspicions as full proof. Once a well-laid scheme came
to naught because at the last moment the owner of the
shop that had been marked down for attack awoke to a
realization of his danger and secured reinforcements.
The outlaws were driven off, and Belle, savagely discontented
and disappointed, came to the conclusion that her
plans had been betrayed by a young farm hand who had
been in her pay as a spy.</p>

<p>She, therefore, sent two of her followers to arrest him,
but the suspect gave them no trouble, for he came
willingly. Then Belle coldly told him of his offence.
He swore he was innocent, but she cut him short by
drawing her revolver and putting a bullet in his brain,
and the gang buried the suspected traitor with as much
nonchalance as they would have interred a dog.</p>

<p>It is impossible, however, to relate all her exploits.
She personally led onslaughts on banks, stores, private
houses, and public buildings.</p>

<p>She had a solution for every problem and a way out of
every difficulty. When one of her men was arrested and
was in imminent danger of death, Belle, finding that the
judge could not be kidnapped, proceeded to make a
prisoner of his wife, and the judge subsequently found a
note pinned to his pillow, informing him that unless the
captured outlaw was allowed to go free the lady would be
murdered. He was given only twenty-four hours to save
her, but, as the town was in a ferment over the excesses
of the gang, the judge, guessing that he dare not acquit
the prisoner, had to connive at his escape in order to
prevent the murder of his wife. He had a bad time of
it when his fellow-citizens heard how they had been
cheated of their prey, and he was compelled to resign,
but as his wife was returned safe and unharmed he was
not sorry that he had placated the outlaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Belle had plenty of friends who worked secretly for her.
They did not take any part in the raids, but they were
very useful in supplying information and warnings, and
more than once the gang escaped, thanks to the timely
advice of these spies. Thus when Belle was heading an
expedition to rob a bank, she looked for and found a
certain mark on the bark of a particular tree within a
couple of miles of the town. That told her that the bank
had obtained the protection of the authorities, and would
be more than a match for the outlaws. She proceeded
no farther, and she afterwards learned that the proprietor
of the bank had planned to capture the gang. Their
disappointment when she and her followers never turned
up at all was a source of amusement to her, and compensated
for the collapse of her plans.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, the Government would not
take any action against the marauders, maintaining
that the local authorities ought to be able to deal with
them. But, when within the space of a month five
banks and six shops were burgled and nine innocent lives
were lost, the Government realized that this was no
local problem but a national affair after all. Belle
Star was terrorizing the country in no unmistakable
manner. Her word was law, and the State was ignored.</p>

<p>Hundreds of small farmers paid her weekly tributes to
save them from being robbed of their all, and things
came to such a pass that some mean-spirited persons
actually proposed that each town should pay ransom
money to Belle if she would only promise to keep away!</p>

<p>When the troops took the field against her Belle's
days were numbered, although she refused to admit this,
and she issued proclamations inviting the soldiers to
come on. Certainly the initial encounters ended favourably
for Belle. She added to her recruits, provided
them with plenty of ammunition, and, setting an example
of fearlessness, led them against the soldiers, and drove
them off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
She had by now her headquarters in the midst of a
forest, and it was possible for travellers to pass within
a few yards of the huts without knowing that they
were there. Beyond the huts was a miniature fortress
which commanded the approach to the forest, and, as
it could be attacked from one side only, it was easy
for half a dozen desperate men, all expert marksmen,
to hold hundreds at bay.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that a regiment of soldiers was
searching for her and her gang, Belle refused to lie low.
Her raids continued, and when a spy of hers appealed
for help she promptly responded, although it involved
great risks. This spy, a woman employed as a cook
in an hotel, had a husband who had been arrested for
a trivial offence, but as he had a bad record it was
certain that if the judge discovered it he would give
the fellow a long sentence.</p>

<p>As the prisoner had come from New York, the police
of the latter city were asked for particulars of his career,
and they responded by sending a list of his previous
convictions to the judge at Galveston.</p>

<p>But the damaging papers arrived on a Friday night,
and before the judge could see them Belle personally
entered the post office, held up the staff, examined the
correspondence, and, having found the bulging packet
from the New York Chief of Police, took it away and
destroyed it. The result was that the spy's husband
was treated as a first offender, and let off with a nominal
fine.</p>

<p>The day after this exploit Belle was riding alone near
her camp, when she was attacked by two soldiers,
who suspected her identity. They followed, thinking
that they could capture the famous brigand easily.
But Belle's object was to separate them, and when the
man on the swifter horse outdistanced his comrade
Belle turned in her saddle and, despite the pace at
which she was going, killed him with her first shot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
His corpse had scarcely struck the ground when a
second bullet ended the career of the other soldier.</p>

<p>These exploits gained for her a great deal of sympathy.
The Texans were essentially a sporting race, and they
argued that if a regiment of soldiers could not overcome
a slip of a girl and a score of brigands then they deserved
to be beaten. This was extraordinary, in view of
the fact that Belle had robbed and pillaged all alike.
The very poor she had spared for the reason that
they were not worth robbing, but it was accounted
a virtue unto her, and numerous acts of benevolence
by her enhanced her reputation.</p>

<p>The fact was that Belle was as cunning as she was
unscrupulous. She distributed money and provisions
amongst the poor and worthless not because she had
any pity for them, but because it was the cheapest way
of obtaining the support at critical moments of a large
portion of the population. Every gaolbird looked up
to Belle as a subject does to a Sovereign, and they
respected her all the more when they knew that she
admitted to membership of her gang only the best
experts in the criminal line.</p>

<p>At least four pitched battles were fought between
the outlaws and the Government soldiers before the
final encounter. Belle seemed to bear a charmed life.
She always headed her colleagues and took the greatest
risks, and when she emerged without a scratch from
the fiercest encounters her ignorant and superstitious
followers began to believe that she was not mortal.
They had often seen her ride at a troop of armed soldiers
and coolly pick off the officers, while all the time a perfect
hail of bullets had sung around her fair head without
touching her.</p>

<p>Whenever the battle was going against the outlaws
it was Belle who revived their drooping courage, and
she twice turned defeat into victory by her marvellous
shooting. The outwitted and beaten commanders were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
compelled to send for reinforcements, and, so variable
is human nature, when a hundred weary and dust-strained
troopers entered Austin, the town they had
come to save, they were jeered at by the ungrateful
inhabitants, who had learnt that in a pitched battle
with Belle Star's outlaws the soldiers had been worsted.</p>

<p>Belle's end was fittingly dramatic. She was celebrating
a run of success against banks and shops with
a feast when news came that two hundred and fifty
soldiers under the command of a major were advancing
to storm the fort. Instantly she sprang to her feet
and ordered every man to his place.</p>

<p>She was sobered in a moment by the news, which
was as unexpected as it was unpleasant; and there
were several of her followers who had drunk too much
to be of use. In vain did Belle shake and curse them
and even implore them to wake up. They could only
stagger forward a few paces and collapse. One man,
in a fit of drunken hilarity and bravado, began to fire
indiscriminately, thereby revealing the hiding-place of
the outlaws, and Belle was so enraged that she brained
him with her carbine. There was no time to remove
the corpse, for the soldiers could be heard approaching
now, and Belle, realizing that this time it was going
to be a fight to a finish, put herself at the head of her
garrison, and prepared to conquer or die.</p>

<p>The outlaws were well entrenched, and had a plentiful
supply of ammunition, but they were up against
equally desperate men now. At last, seeing that if
they remained in the fort those who were not killed
outright would be captured, Belle personally led a
sortie against the enemy, hoping to escape in the confusion.
The men followed her gladly, remembering
their previous victories, but most of them were still
fuddled by drink, and in the circumstances could not
be expected to show to advantage.</p>

<p>Belle was the only one to fight at her best. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
displayed amazing courage, time after time heading
attacks on the troopers, who were so flustered as to
show signs of panic. But the commander rallied them,
and as by now the troopers regarded Belle Star as a
demon and not as a human being they pressed forward
to destroy her without being affected by her
sex or age. When things were going against her she
collected a few of her followers, and made one last
desperate attempt to break through the ring of soldiers,
but her luck failed her, and she fell riddled with bullets.
It was the death she had always desired.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WOMAN WITH THE FATAL EYES</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Jeanne</span> Daniloff was reared in an atmosphere
of mystery, intrigue and squalor. Her father
was one of the many victims of Russian tyranny,
and he had been forced to wander about Europe, going
from one cheap boarding-house to another, accompanied
by a wife who resented his lack of worldly success, and
by a daughter who, as she grew older, rebelled against
the squalid isolation of the life they were leading.</p>

<p>But Jeanne was not the sort of girl to accept her fate
quietly. She had inherited her father's fanaticism,
though she never applied it to political purposes, and
also her mother's temper, and, becoming tired of the
frequent quarrels between her parents, she eloped to
Paris with an old gentleman. Jeanne was not sixteen,
well developed, hardly a beauty, but possessed of a
pair of remarkable eyes. She was well described later
as "The woman with the fatal eyes." Jeanne was
not destined to live many years, and yet during her
brief career she hypnotized to their ruin three men, all
of whom were, presumably, persons of education and
position.</p>

<p>The ambitious, fiery-natured Russian girl meant to
have a good time. Jeanne Daniloff was a curious
mixture of pride and self-abasement. She hated poverty
and she loved love. In her opinion the world ought to
have been populated only by handsome men able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
provide her with every luxury, with a sprinkling of
women to flatter her by their jealousy. Warm-hearted
and warm-blooded, reared in poverty and trouble,
Jeanne Daniloff was born to play a tragic rôle on the
stage of life.</p>

<p>Her first escapade did not last longer than six months
and by the time her elderly friend had deserted her
Jeanne was an orphan. At that moment her fate was
trembling in the balance, and she might have been left
in her loneliness to sink to the lowest depths had not her
grandmother, who had always loved the reckless and
irresponsible girl, offered her a home. Jeanne accepted,
and went to live at Nice, encouraged, no doubt, by
the knowledge that Nice had many carnivals, and was
a resort of the rich.</p>

<p>Her grandmother, who kept a boarding-house, was
soon cured of her delusion that Jeanne would help her
in the conduct of her establishment. Household work
was not to the liking of the young girl, who thought
only of dresses and dances and men, and while the old
lady was left to look after her boarders Jeanne spent
the days reading novels and the nights dancing. She
became a well-known figure at the numerous dancing
halls in Nice, and most men forgot her rather plain
features once they came under the spell of her "fatal
eyes." Jeanne had only to look at a man to bring him
to her feet. Once she realized her power she revelled
in it, and, despite her aptitude for doing nothing, she
managed to educate herself to hold her own in the best
society, into which she sometimes strayed.</p>

<p>There is always at least one critical turning point in
the careers of women of the Daniloff type, and Jeanne's
came unexpectedly at a ball at Nice. She was chatting
with a couple of friends between dances when the master
of ceremonies begged to be allowed to present a newcomer
to her. A few moments later Jeanne Daniloff
was face to face with a tall, pale young man with a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
mouth and a nervous manner. Jeanne looked at him
with her fatal eyes, and he was her slave.</p>

<p>Weiss was a lieutenant in the French Army, of good
family, and with a future. In that crowd of adventurers
and witlings he was a somebody, and when the following
day he called on Jeanne at her grandmother's boarding-house
he thrilled her with a proposal of marriage. It
was not unexpected. Jeanne must have known that
she had fascinated him, but she was nevertheless pleased
at the prospect of becoming Madame Weiss, and in her
usual manner she flung herself impetuously into the
arms of her lover.</p>

<p>Her happiness was short-lived, however. Weiss's
mother, when she heard of her son's intention, made
it her business to interview Jeanne. Madame Weiss
was not to be fascinated by the "fatal eyes," and she
summed up the character of the boarding-house siren
in terms that left no doubt in her son's mind that she
would never consent to the union. As according to the
law of France the young officer could not marry without
his mother's permission the brief engagement between
him and Jeanne came to an end.</p>

<p>The Russian girl quickly recovered her spirits and
once again abandoned herself to the gaieties of Nice.
The prospect of losing her turned Weiss's love into a
burning passion. He attended balls just to catch a
glimpse of her; and it maddened him to see her smiling
into the faces of men he imagined to be his rivals. Daily
he pestered his mother to give her consent, but she held
out against him, and at last Weiss had to resort to
desperate measures.</p>

<p>With his promotion to the rank of captain he received
orders to go to Oran in Algiers. The night before he
was due to leave Nice he sought out Jeanne and implored
her to elope with him. Of course he was in complete
ignorance of the fact that the girl had already had that
"affair" with that elderly gentleman which had terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
in Paris. Young Weiss used all the eloquence
of which he was capable, unable to realize that he was
addressing one to whom elopement appealed irresistibly
because it was an adventure.</p>

<p>They left together for Oran, and shortly after their
arrival set up housekeeping under the soft, alluring
skies of Algiers. The humid climate suited Jeanne.
The mysticism and romantic beauty of North Africa
captivated her; she revelled in the colour, the movement
and the variety of the native towns and villages.
As the reputed wife of Captain Weiss she mixed in the
best society, and Jeanne was soon a popular hostess,
whilst her fascination for men was as remarkable as
ever it had been.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the much-in-love Weiss had not ceased
to pester his mother, and she, feeling that it would be
foolish to resist any longer, gave her consent, and Captain
Weiss and Jeanne Daniloff were married.</p>

<p>The ceremony had a curious effect upon Jeanne.
She became deeply religious. Every morning she read
the Bible, and her prayers were never neglected. She
took to visiting the poor and her charity was boundless.
Her husband was delighted. He was her most devoted
admirer, and as he possessed qualities which made him
an ideal husband she ought to have been very happy.</p>

<p>For a time Jeanne mastered herself sufficiently to
appreciate him and to show her devotion by living only
for him. His abilities had by now been recognized by
the French Government, which had permitted him to
retire from the army and take a well-paid civil appointment
in the Algerian service. There was, therefore,
no lack of money, and when in course of time Jeanne
was the mother of two fine children, a son and a daughter,
she seemed to be the happiest wife and mother in Oran.</p>

<p>She had the means to give dinner-parties and garden-parties,
and the very best people were amongst her
intimate friends. It was, indeed, a decided change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
from the boarding-house at Nice and the cheap dancing
halls.</p>

<p>Soon after the birth of her second child&mdash;in the early
part of 1889&mdash;Captain Weiss bought a charming house
and grounds at Ain-Fezza, near Oran. It was an ideal
residence, and everyone envied Madame Weiss her
home, her children and her husband. She had the
reputation of being a most devout Christian and a
good wife and mother.</p>

<p>The Paris elopement seemed to belong to another
world. The reckless pleasure-seeking Jeanne Daniloff
might never have existed, yet the time was fast approaching
when her real self was to come to the surface
again. Nothing could have prevented her being herself.
She could not help her own nature. The daughter
of the Russian revolutionaries, a veritable child of
storm, could not maintain the character she had earned
in Oran; and when all appeared well with her she
plunged into a murderous intrigue which cost her everything&mdash;home,
children, husband and life!</p>

<p>In the year 1889 an engineer of the name of Felix
Roques came to Ain-Fezza to work on the Algerian
Railways. He had not been long in the place when he
was compelled to listen to glowing accounts of Madame
Weiss, in which her piety and love for her family were
dilated upon. Roques's curiosity was aroused. It
seemed impossible that the world should contain so
perfect a creature as they told him Madame Weiss was.
At this time Jeanne was only twenty-one, and in the
full possession of her powers, physical and mental.</p>

<p>Felix Roques had no difficulty in making her acquaintance.
In common with the principal employés
of the company that was constructing the railway, he
was invited to a garden-party at Madame Weiss's,
and there he was introduced to her by her husband.
For some extraordinary reason the sight of Felix Roques
aroused in Madame Weiss's breast all those doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
passions which had lain dormant since her flight from
Nice. In a moment she was Jeanne Daniloff again.
She fell straightway in love with the handsome engineer.
Home, husband, children and reputation became as
nothing to her. She dropped the mask and was the wild
child of nature again. All the blood of her fanatical,
revolutionary ancestors coursed through her veins,
warmed by the balmy African sun.</p>

<p>She was really in love at last. That was what she
told herself. She had married Captain Weiss to escape
from the dreary boarding-house and the commonplace
persons her grandmother catered for. She had tolerated
him because he gave her social position, and she had
accepted boredom because she wished to be with her
children. But now she was in love, and Felix Roques,
whose features were regular without making him startlingly
handsome, fell under the spell of the fateful eyes,
and was never the same man again.</p>

<p>The lovers had many secret meetings, and even when
they met at parties could not conceal their affection.
Friends warned Weiss; but he only laughed at them.
Was not his wife the most religious woman in Oran?
Had he not the evidence of his own senses that she
was devoted to him and to their little boy and girl?
"You are talking nonsense, my friend," he would answer
calmly, and go about his duties, and once, to show his
confidence in his wife, asked Felix Roques to take her
to an evening party because business would detain him
at his office.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when Madame Weiss and
Felix Roques decided that it was impossible for either
of them to be content with simple dalliance. The
hypnotized engineer declared that Jeanne must give
herself completely to him.</p>

<p>The suggestion was met with a pleased laugh. Jeanne
liked a strong, determined lover, and not a milksop of
a husband who let her have her own way in everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I will give her own description of this scene with her
lover. It reveals the temperament of the woman in a
remarkable way.</p>

<p>"I loved Monsieur Roques as the master of my
thoughts, of my intelligence, of my body, of every fibre
of my being, as a master whom I worshipped, and in
whose presence I myself ceased to exist," she wrote.
"When he asked me for the first time to appoint him
an assignation we were walking with some other people.
Instead of saying yes or no I took out a coin and said
to him, 'I don't wish to take on myself the responsibility
of a decision; you know that if once we begin to love
it will be no light thing for me. I shall lead you far,
perhaps farther than you think. If it comes down heads
it shall be yes; if tails, no.' He looked very astonished;
he blushed very deeply and said, 'So be it.' I spun
the coin; it came down heads, and I was his."</p>

<p>The astounding nature of this female criminal is
proved by the fact that to celebrate her downfall she
had a ring engraved with the date, November 13, 1889!</p>

<p>Once she was committed to him her love became a
mania. She wrote to him daily, and at night, when she
had superintended the putting to bed of her children,
she would sit down beside their cot and scribble pages
of ecstatic praise of the young engineer.</p>

<p>Some of those letters have been preserved, and I will
give one or two specimens.</p>

<p>"Dearest," she wrote a fortnight after she had betrayed
her husband, "you do not know how I hold to
life now. Does it not promise to me in the future days
of radiant happiness, intimacy, affection growing daily
stronger, with you, my beloved, you to whom I am
proud to belong, you for whom I am capable of any
sacrifice, any act of devotion? How I love you, Felix!
Take all the kisses I can give you and many more. I
embrace you with all the strength of my being.&mdash;Your
wife, Jeanne."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Several months passed, and everybody in the district
except Weiss knew of the intimacy between his wife
and Roques. The infatuated man refused to believe
a word against her, and his wife rewarded him by eventually
coming to the conclusion that he was in her way,
and that she must "remove" him in order to attain
to the fullest happiness with Felix Roques.</p>

<p>The guilty couple often discussed the possibility
of murdering Weiss without having to pay the penalty.
Like everybody else they had been fascinated by the
lurid English drama known as "The Maybrick Case."
They had read full details of the "removing" of James
Maybrick by arsenic, and the very complete French
reports of the sensational Liverpool trial introduced
Jeanne Weiss to many of the mysteries of arsenical
poisoning. She knew that there were ways of obtaining
poison without having to name that dread word, and
when the fatal step was resolved on she voted for Fowler's
solution as the medium.</p>

<p>A remarkable correspondence led up to the opening act
of the drama. She sent Roques a letter, in which she
said, "I am beset with sad and depressing thoughts.
What I am about to do is very ugly."</p>

<p>Later she wrote, "I prefer Fowler's solution to begin
with. It is agreed, Felix. You shall be obeyed. Have
I ever hesitated before anything except the desertion of
my children? Crimes against the law don't trouble
me at all. It is only crimes against Nature that revolt
me. I am a worshipper of Nature."</p>

<p>Another remarkable reference to the forthcoming
attempt on her husband's life must be quoted, "I
have been playing the Danse Macabre as a duet. My
nerves must be affected, for it produced a gloomy effect
upon me. I thought of death and of those who are
about to die. Can it be that this feeling will return to
me? But it is so sweet to think that I am working for
our nest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
The last letter she penned before the actual poisoning
began was an outburst of love and hysteria.</p>

<p>"Oh, Felix, love me, for the hideousness of my task
glares at me. I want to close my heart and my soul
and my eyes. I want to banish the recollection of
what he has done for me, for I worship you. I feel
such a currency of complete intimacy between you
and me that words seem unnecessary. We read each
other's thoughts as in an open book. To arrest this
current would be to arrest my life. I may shudder at
what I am doing after it is done, but go back I cannot.
Comfort and sustain me; help me to get over the inevitable
moments of depression, bind me under your
yoke. Make me drunk with your caresses, for therein
lies your own power. I will be yours, whatever happens.
So long as you give me your orders I will carry them out.
But it seems to me I am doing wrong. I love you
terribly."</p>

<p>Weiss became ill in October, 1890, mysteriously ill,
for the local doctor was greatly puzzled. The patient's
young wife&mdash;she was only twenty-two&mdash;nursed him
with apparent devotion. She would allow no one else
to give him his food, and, of course, her reason for this
was the fact that no one else could be relied upon to mix
arsenic with it!</p>

<p>When friends of the family called Jeanne's distress
touched their hearts. She was implored not to risk
a breakdown herself by overdoing the day and night
nursing of her ailing husband, and they advised her to
employ professional help. With a wan smile Jeanne
announced her determination to nurse him tenderly
herself, and sacrifice her own life if necessary for him.
There had been adverse rumours concerning Jeanne
Weiss in Oran and the neighbourhood, but in the
face of this unexampled devotion to her husband
they seemed to be the inventions of unscrupulous
enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The doctor grew more puzzled. Just when his patient
seemed to be improving he would have a relapse, and
there was a curious ill-luck about the ministrations
of Madame Weiss. He did not see that Jeanne was only
acting the part of the distressed and anxious wife.
It was her pale face and tearful manner that kept his
eyes closed to the truth.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Weiss had a secretary,
Guerry, whose wife was a friend of Mademoiselle Castaing,
the postmistress at Ain-Fezza, a lady whose bump of
curiosity was abnormally developed, for she was in the
habit of passing her time by opening the letters that
came through her office, and reading the contents.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, in fact, knew more about the intrigue
between Madame Weiss and Felix Roques than anyone
else, and it was only by exercising the rarest self-control
that she refrained from publishing far and wide the
news that Roques had gone to Spain to be out of the
way when Weiss died, and that Madame Weiss was to
join him later in Madrid with her children. She knew
also that months before Jeanne had refused to elope
with Roques, because that would have meant parting
from her children, the custody of whom would be given
to her deserted husband by the Court. It was
because she wished to keep her children that she
decided to murder her husband instead of simply
leaving him.</p>

<p>Guerry, the secretary, was devoted to his employer.
When Weiss became worse he reported the fact to
Madame Guerry, and that lady sniffed meaningly and
finally blurted out the gossip she had heard from the
postmistress.</p>

<p>Instantly the secretary's suspicions were aroused.
He felt certain that Jeanne was poisoning her husband,
and when on October 9 his wife hinted that Madame
Weiss had posted an important letter addressed to
Felix Roques at Madrid, and that the letter was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
lying in Mademoiselle Castaing's post office, he promptly
went down to see the lady whose curiosity was the
direct means of saving a wronged man's life.</p>

<p>It was, of course, against the regulations for the postmistress
to discuss her duties with outsiders, and Guerry,
unwilling to put her in an embarrassing position, cut
the Gordian knot by stealing Madame Weiss's letter.
When he got home he read it, and a more remarkable
document was never penned.</p>

<p>"You may as well know what a fearful time I am
going through at this moment&mdash;in what a nightmare
I live," Jeanne wrote. "Monsieur has been in bed
four days, and the best half of my stock is used up.
He fights it&mdash;fights it by his sheer vitality and instinct
of self-preservation, so that he seems to absorb emetics
and never drains a cup or a glass to its dregs. The
doctor, who came yesterday, could find no disease.
'He's a madman, a hypochondriac,' he said. 'Since
he seems to want to be sick, give him some ipecacuanha,
and don't worry. There's nothing seriously the matter
with him.'</p>

<p>"The constant sickness obliges me to administer
the remedy in very small doses. I can't go beyond
twenty drops without bringing on vomiting. Yesterday
from five in the morning until four in the afternoon
I have done nothing but empty basins, clean sheets,
wash his face, and hold him down in the bed during
his paroxysms of sickness. At night when I have got
away for a moment I have put my head on Mademoiselle
Castaing's shoulder and sobbed like a child. I
am afraid, afraid that I haven't got enough of the
remedy left, and that I shan't be able to bring it off.
Couldn't you send me some by parcel post to the railway
station of Ain-Fezza? Can't you send four or five pairs
of children's socks with the bottle? I'll take care to get
rid of the wrapper. Hide the bottle carefully.</p>

<p>"I'm getting thinner every day. I don't look well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and I am afraid when I see you I shan't please you.
Did you get the photograph?</p>

<p>"Forgive my handwriting, but I am horribly nervous.
I adore you."</p>

<p>The secretary handed the letter to the Public Prosecutor
at Oran, and immediately Jeanne Weiss was
arrested. The police were only just in time. Another
day's delay and Weiss must have died, for the doctors
had to work desperately before they could report that
he was mending. When she was put in prison Jeanne
tried to commit suicide, but a strong emetic preserved
her life. Then followed a genuine illness, and for six
months she was in the prison infirmary.</p>

<p>She had been allowed to take her infant with her,
but it sickened in goal and died, greatly to her distress,
for although Jeanne could plot to receive arsenic with
which to poison her husband, and could ask her lover
to hide the bottle in children's socks, she was devoted
to her babies. A curious contradiction, yet it was
because of this that, instead of deserting Weiss, she
chose rather to poison him.</p>

<p>A perusal of Madame Weiss's papers left no doubt
in the minds of the authorities that Felix Roques was
her guilty accomplice, and the services of the Spanish
police were utilized to effect his arrest in Madrid. Roques,
however, had no intention of facing the music, and he
contrived to smuggle a revolver into the Spanish goal,
and with it he blew out his brains. The young Russian
woman was left, therefore, to answer alone the serious
charge of having attempted to murder her husband.</p>

<p>The trial did not take place until the last week in May,
1891, when Jeanne Weiss was just twenty-three. She
had, indeed, lived her life. In experience and intrigue
she was an old woman, and it was hard to credit the
story of her career as laid before judge and jury by the
prosecutor. During her incarceration she had composed
a sort of autobiography in which she attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
to put all the responsibility on Felix Roques, and when
tired of that she persuaded herself that her husband
had forgiven her, and that he would save her from
punishment by giving evidence on her behalf. It was
sheer invention, but it enabled her to enter the Court
without a tremor, and feel hopeful of an acquittal.</p>

<p>The trial was conducted with all the emotion of which
a French Court can be capable, and had it not been for
the proofs in the prisoner's own handwriting her youth
and her "fatal eyes" might have saved her from conviction.
Jeanne's chief hope was that the sight of her
distress might reawaken the love her husband first bore
for her, the love that had once caused him to quarrel
with his own mother. But Weiss had been sickened
to the soul by the realization of her treachery. He could
not look upon her without shuddering with horror,
and from the moment he had been convinced that she
had tried to murder him he declined to give her his
name. Henceforth she was Jeanne Daniloff, and not
Madame Weiss, and he would not permit anyone to
speak of her as his wife.</p>

<p>Jeanne, who had decided to commit suicide if she was
convicted, came into Court with a handkerchief which
she constantly pressed against her face. No one knew
that in the corner of it was a piece of cigarette paper
which contained a dose of strychnine. This was to
be her last resource if the verdict of the jury went against
her.</p>

<p>The critical moment came when Weiss stepped into
the witness-box. Now that Felix Roques was dead
Weiss was the only person who could tell the inner history
of the intrigue. Jeanne hoped that he would
suppress everything likely to damage her, and all the
time he was being questioned she kept her eyes on him.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Weiss was an older and a wiser,
if sadder man now. Jeanne's eyes were no longer
capable of hypnotizing him, and he simply told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
truth. When he was given permission to leave the
box he turned abruptly towards the jury and addressed
them.</p>

<p>"I desire, gentlemen," he said, "to make the following
declaration: I speak that I may reply to certain
calumnies that have appeared in the press. I have
never forgiven Jeanne Daniloff. I do not, and I never
will, forgive her. Henceforth she is nothing to me.
Whatever her fate, I stay near my children. I only
wish never to hear her name again."</p>

<p>That statement sealed the doom of the accused. She
uttered a gasp of terror, and would have fallen had
not the wardress clutched her, and although the trial
continued for several hours longer she scarcely understood
what was happening.</p>

<p>It was at four o'clock in the morning when the jury
returned a verdict of guilty, "with extenuating circumstances,"
and but for the latter the convict would
have been sentenced to death.</p>

<p>The fatal eyes had, in fact, saved her; but Jeanne
Weiss had no desire for life. To her, death was far
more preferable than existence within prison walls,
and when the judge's sentence was still ringing in her
ears she bit her handkerchief as though trying to steady
her nerves, though in reality she was swallowing the
dose of strychnine she had concealed in the hem. A
request to the wardress for a glass of water was instantly
complied with, and Jeanne then washed the fatal poison
down. A few moments later she was shrieking in agony.</p>

<p>They carried her into an adjoining room, and a doctor
administered an emetic, but already the deadly dose
was accomplishing its task. Jeanne Weiss was dying,
and those who had assisted to bring her to justice stood
around her as she passed into another world.</p>

<p>The manner of her going was in keeping with her
character. Wild, turbulent, passionate, fierce and unscrupulous,
Jeanne Daniloff was a revolutionary, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
who rebelled against the laws of mankind. She took
her own life gladly, and her last words were references
to her children and to the man for whom she had sacrificed
so much.</p>

<p>She appeared anxious to spare her children the disgrace
of having a convict for a mother, but it was really her
husband's repudiation and the knowledge of her lover's
death that had inspired her to revise the sentence of
the Court and execute herself.</p>

<span class="subhead">MADAME RACHEL<br /><br />

THE BEAUTY SPECIALIST</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Anybody</span> who has sufficient self-assurance to
set up as a "beauty specialist" will never
want for clients as long as there are middle-aged
and ugly women in existence and vanity continues
to be one of the most common weaknesses of
humanity. But when Rachel Leverson, an unscrupulous
London Jewess, claimed to have discovered a
process by which she could make members of her own
sex beautiful for ever she struck out into a new line,
and one that proved eminently successful until the
police intervened.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel, as she called herself, had no pretensions
to good looks. She was, to tell the truth,
repulsive in appearance, being stout, with a greasy
skin, irregular features, eyes that repelled, and a manner
that was generally familiar and always irritating. But
just as men will buy a hair-restorer from a bald-headed
barber so will women flock to an ugly creature to learn
the secret of beauty. Madame Rachel was ugly in
mind as well as in body; she was rapacious and unscrupulous,
and yet for years she prospered as a "beauty
doctor."</p>

<p>It was a very risky business that Madame Rachel
brought into existence, but, despite her audacious
frauds, it was not without difficulty that she was convicted
in a court of law and punished for her crimes.</p>

<p>Before starting as a "beauty specialist" Rachel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Leverson had tried fortune-telling, but the profits had
been too small and clients too few, and she quickly
retired from it to strike out on new lines, and she did
not have to wait very long before her bank balance
justified her enterprise.</p>

<p>The woman's headquarters were in a house at the
corner of Maddox Street and New Bond Street, and
were, therefore, right in the heart of fashionable
London.</p>

<p>Her methods were a mixture of quackery, blackmail,
subserviency and bullying, and, realizing that most
people do not value anything which is not costly, she
charged enormous fees. Whenever she quoted them
she did so in a reluctant manner, as if to suggest that
she personally got nothing out of the business, and
was, in fact, really a philanthropist. Of course, she
relied principally on her knowledge of the weaknesses
of her sex, and those would-be clients whose financial
position obviously precluded them from adding to her
profits she skilfully used to advertise her merits.</p>

<p>On one occasion the widow of a Civil Servant, a
lady in the fifties, who had lost her good looks many
years earlier in the hot suns of India, applied to Madame
Rachel to be made beautiful for ever, being unaware
that the Jewess charged a hundred guineas for the
preliminary treatment only and that she required a
thousand guineas for the full course. But as the lady
was in society Madame Rachel did not drive her away
with contumely, as she had persons of low degree.
She merely surveyed her caller, and then announced
that she could not accept less than five hundred guineas
"on account."</p>

<div id="ip_64" class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;"><img src="images/i_064fp.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">"MADAME RACHEL"</div></div>

<p>"You should understand," said Madame Rachel,
leaning back in an arm-chair, and speaking in an impressive
manner, "that the process I have discovered
is known only to myself, and that it is a very expensive
one to work. I have to charge high fees not only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
that reason, but to make sure that only ladies of rank
and fortune will patronize me. <i>Ladies</i> will keep my
secret, I know. If they didn't I should be out of work"&mdash;here
she laughed&mdash;"in a month. I am sorry that
you cannot afford the course of treatment, for I am
sure that it would do all you require. Still, it can't
be helped."</p>

<p>The widow went off to tell her acquaintances, and,
incidentally, to get half a dozen friends to lend her
sufficient money to undergo the expensive treatment.
In return she promised that as soon as she had discovered
the secret process she would reveal it to them,
and then they could make themselves beautiful without
having to spend another penny or consult the beauty
doctor.</p>

<p>A week later the widow paid Madame Rachel the
five hundred guineas, and at once began the treatment.
It continued for a month, during which time the victim
drank all sorts of medicines, had innumerable baths,
sat in dark rooms for hours, and painted her skin with
vile concoctions. Instead of becoming more beautiful,
she got even uglier, and at last she came to the conclusion
that she was being trifled with. As soon as she
realized this she demanded the return of her five hundred
guineas.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel, who had hitherto acted the part
of the sleek, half-obsequious, half-familiar friend, burst
into a roar of laughter when the request was made,
and, towering over the widow, with her greasy face
distorted with passion, and her heavy thick hands
clenched, she cursed, threatened and jeered.</p>

<p>"I will not give you more than a minute to leave
my premises," she shouted, in conclusion, and she
looked capable of murdering her dissatisfied client.
"I suppose you think that because I am an unprotected
woman trying to earn an honest living that you can
bluff me? I have spent the whole of your fee on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
treatment and haven't made a penny profit, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a lie," cried the courageous widow. "Don't
shout at me, woman. I am going straight to my solicitor
to instruct him to issue a writ against you."</p>

<p>Madame Rachel laughed horribly.</p>

<p>"Splendid," she cried, clapping her hands. "Nothing
would please me better. I should revel in such a
law case, and so would your friends. Wouldn't they
laugh when they heard that the ugliest woman in England
was so stupidly vain as not to know that only a
miracle could make her beautiful! How they will jeer
at you! You'll be the laughing stock of London! I
can imagine how the papers will report the case. And
the headlines! It will be a treat to listen to the cross-examination
by my counsel, who will know all that
has passed between you and me. Oh, by all means
go to your solicitor, and as a personal favour I implore
you to bring an action against me. It would be the
best possible advertisement for my business."</p>

<p>The widow went, but the writ never came, for on
second thoughts she decided that it would be better
to forego the luxury of revenge than to hold herself
up to ridicule. Madame Rachel had anticipated this,
and it was the real reason why she dealt only with
persons of good social position who would not dare to
invite publicity.</p>

<p>Another victim was the wife of a man who was a
prominent member of the Conservative Party. She
had heard a lot about Madame Rachel, and she decided
to seek her advice as to the best method of improving
her skin, which was unpleasantly sallow. The swindler
pretended that she had an infallible remedy for this,
and when the statesman's wife called she did not hesitate
to guarantee a cure, provided her instructions
were followed. Madame Rachel advised daily baths
and the use of certain cosmetics, and for these a very
stiff fee was paid in advance. Three times a week the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
lady came to the establishment to undergo the treatment,
and Madame Rachel was always in attendance,
with a huge smile and plenty of flattery.</p>

<p>It happened that in the course of conversation Madame
Rachel had learned from her client that she was taking
the treatment unknown to her husband because she
wished to give him a pleasant surprise. Husband
and wife were as deeply in love with one another as
they had been on their wedding day, and the lady
lived only to please him, and she thought that if she
suddenly presented herself before him with a beautiful
skin he would be enchanted. The information greatly
interested the swindler, whose greedy eyes had noticed
that the lady wore on her fingers diamond rings which
could not have cost less than a thousand pounds.</p>

<p>During the first week of the treatment, which mainly
consisted of taking baths, the client wore her rings
all the time. But Madame Rachel pretended that
they hampered her process, and so she insisted upon
the lady discarding them with her clothes before entering
the bath. The request was complied with&mdash;the
"beauty specialist" had a wonderful power over her
customers&mdash;and as a result the "patient" never saw
her rings again. When she missed them after returning
from the bath, she immediately rang the bell and complained
to the maid. The next moment Madame
Rachel burst into the room in a rage and began to pour
a stream of filthy abuse upon her client, who saw at
once that the "beauty specialist" was the thief, and
taxed her with the crime. Instead of repudiating the
accusation, she retorted by declaring that unless the
lady went at once and gave no more trouble she would
declare that she had been to her house to meet a gentleman
by appointment who was not her husband.</p>

<p>"You never told your husband that you've been
coming here," she screamed triumphantly, noticing
the look of dismay and fright on her client's face. "It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
been a secret to him. What would he say if I told him,
and my assistants confirmed me, that you'd been keeping
clandestine appointments with a lover? Go and let
me hear no more of your alleged losses, or it'll be the
worse for you."</p>

<p>That lady was not very wise, for she did not tell
her husband at once how she had been tricked. Had
she consulted him immediately he would have taken
steps to recover the jewellery, but it was too late to do
anything when she admitted how she had allowed herself
to be robbed.</p>

<p>All the time there was a steady flow of clients who
paid enormous fees and solemnly went through the
farcial programme which Madame Rachel guaranteed
would confer everlasting beauty upon them. They
were mainly middle-aged widows and old maids, who
fancied that certain distinguished men of their acquaintance
had grown "interested" in them, and would
propose if only they were a little more attractive or
appeared just a few years younger. When clients were
without eligible male friends the "beauty specialist"
undertook to supply them with husbands for a consideration.
Indeed, there was nothing she would not
promise in return for a substantial sum of money.</p>

<p>Her strongest protection was the knowledge that
her patrons feared ridicule more than the loss of their
money. Dissatisfied clients occasionally created scenes
at the beauty shop, and then Madame Rachel treated
them to language which sent them scampering
from her premises. But the majority took their disappointment
quietly, not even registering a protest
when after months of "treatment" they found themselves
worse than when they had started.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the money rolled in, and Madame Rachel,
who had once told fortunes in vile public-houses at a
penny a time, now sported a carriage and pair, and was
frequently seen in the most fashionable restaurants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
When strangers saw her they invariably inquired as
to the identity of the vulgar creature, and the usual
answer was, "She's the famous Madame Rachel, who
is the greatest beauty specialist in the world. She
has accomplished miracles, I am told." Thus was her
fame extended.</p>

<p>But suddenly the number of patrons began to diminish
perceptibly, greatly to the alarm of the swindler, whose
great ambition was to provide such handsome dowries
for her two daughters as would win for them titled husbands.
She had already saved thousands of pounds,
but she required much more for her purpose, and it
was quite by accident she discovered how to improve
upon her swindle.</p>

<p>A certain woman of thirty, plain and uncouth, came
to her to be changed into a beauty. She had the money
to pay for the process, and Madame Rachel took her in
hand. Alice Maynard was one of those women who
never attract men, and she was fully conscious of the
fact. When she confided her griefs to the "sympathetic"
sharper she was at once promised a husband with
a title on the condition that she would reward her
benefactress for her trouble. Miss Maynard cheerfully
promised anything, and from time to time handed over
various sums, ranging from ten guineas to a hundred.</p>

<p>When informed that the woman's savings were exhausted
Madame Rachel introduced her to a man who
called himself the "Hon. George Sylvester." He
proposed at once, was accepted, and married the girl
shortly afterwards. Then the "Hon. George," having
borrowed fifty pounds from his bride, disappeared, and
it was only when the weeping woman consulted a book
on the peerage with a view to communicating with her
husband's relatives that she discovered that there
was no titled family of the name of Sylvester. Later
a solicitor elicited the information for her that the man
she had married was a bookmaker's tout, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
escorted other ladies to the altar, and for whom the
police were searching.</p>

<p>Alice Maynard, broken-hearted and ashamed, retired
to the country, to die within a few months, leaving
Madame Rachel in peaceful possession of the seven
hundred pounds she had had from her. Madame had
paid the "Hon. George Sylvester" five pounds to
pose as the son of a peer and marry the forlorn young
lady, and, as she anticipated, it proved a cheap method
for getting rid of her.</p>

<p>The success, from Madame Rachel's point of view,
of this affair caused her to develop it on a larger scale,
and very soon another victim presented herself for
the purpose of being plucked. As this deluded creature
seemed likely to yield thousands of pounds, the "beauty
specialist" prepared to reap a rich harvest.</p>

<p>One evening a thin, spare, scraggy little woman with
yellow hair, obviously dyed, painted face and eyebrows,
and the affected giggle of a schoolgirl, called at the
beauty shop in Bond Street. She introduced herself
as Mrs. Borradaile, the widow of Colonel Borradaile,
and she asked that she might be made beautiful for
ever, because, although fifty, she had the heart of a
child, and she wished to marry again, if possible.</p>

<p>Even Madame Rachel, with all her experience, had
the greatest difficulty in preventing herself from laughing
at this human caricature, but as Mrs. Borradaile
made no secret of her strong financial position she entered
seriously into negotiations. Her first question was
about the amount the widow wished to spend, and the
answer was that she did not want to pay more than a
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel pretended to be satisfied, and there
and then she accepted ten pounds on account, a sum
she had often before refused with scorn. But she knew
that Mrs. Borradaile could be bled if properly treated,
and she proved the correctness of this view by getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
from her in the course of the first month four hundred
guineas.</p>

<p>The widow was crazy to become beautiful, and, when
chance enabled the swindler to get Mrs. Borradaile
completely in her power, the rest was easy. The two
women were discussing the treatment in Madame
Rachel's private room when a maid entered with a card.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel read the name on it with surprise.</p>

<p>"Lord Ranelagh!" she exclaimed, and her astonishment
was genuine, for she did not know the peer. "I
wonder why he has come! It can't be that he wishes
to be a client."</p>

<p>Mrs. Borradaile was greatly impressed by the rank
of the visitor, and during the quarter of an hour the
"beauty specialist" was absent from the room she
thought of nothing else except the exclusiveness of her
visiting-list. Evidently the woman's oft-repeated claim
to be in society was true.</p>

<p>Mrs. Borradaile knew nothing of Lord Ranelagh's
reputation. He was an idler of doubtful habits, who,
with advancing years, could not lose the delusion that
he was a lady-killer. He spent his time running after
women, and his call on Madame Rachel was simply
inspired by curiosity. He did not know the woman,
but he wanted to hear something of her wonderful
method, rightly guessing that he would not be repulsed
on account of his social position.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel received him with flattering cordiality,
and invited him to come again. The peer accepted the
invitation, and in that moment the "beauty specialist,"
who knew how to take advantage of an opportunity,
evolved quite a brilliant scheme for the discomfiture
of the widow who was waiting her return.</p>

<p>Affecting enthusiasm and surprise, she sank into
the chair beside Mrs. Borradaile, looked at her meaningly,
seized her hand, and pressed it between her own.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, my dear," she whispered, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mrs. Borradaile's unfeigned amazement. "You have
achieved a wonderful conquest."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," Mrs. Borradaile stammered,
thinking that Madame Rachel had gone mad.</p>

<p>"Lord Ranelagh!" she replied, with another pressure
of her hot, fat hands. "He really came to see
you. He's been following you to my establishment
every day, and he called just now to inquire about you."
She giggled, and her large black eyes twinkled. "Lord
Ranelagh is the wealthiest bachelor peer in England,"
she whispered. "I congratulate you, Mrs. Borradaile,
for when the treatment is finished, and you have satisfied
his lordship's standard of beauty, he will make you
Lady Ranelagh. He told me so in confidence, and
you must never let a soul know that I've imparted the
secret to you. What a great future is yours!"</p>

<p>From that moment Mrs. Borradaile was Madame
Rachel's body and soul. The foolish woman actually
agreed to pay three thousand pounds to be made beautiful,
and she paid six hundred pounds on account. She
was too vain to entertain the slightest doubts as to
Madame Rachel's truthfulness, and when she was introduced
to Lord Ranelagh at her own request, and a
few commonplace remarks passed between them, she
was absolutely convinced that the peer had fallen in
love with her, and that when the "beauty specialist"
had finished with her she would become the "Right
Hon. Lady Ranelagh."</p>

<p>It was a very remarkable "courtship," and it is
sometimes difficult to believe, judging by her part in it,
that Mrs. Borradaile was quite sane, although later
she recovered sufficiently to start the criminal proceedings
that brought the "beauty shop" to an end. But
during the period when she was daily undergoing baths
and using up a large amount of cosmetics she swallowed
every story the adventuress told her, and allowed herself
to be led by the nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
No courtship being complete without love-letters,
the ingenious Madame Rachel had not the heart to
deprive Mrs. Borradaile of the pleasure of hearing from
her lover. It was true that Lord Ranelagh had no
intention of marrying Mrs. Borradaile, for he was only
interested in her because he was curious to see whether
the "beauty doctor" could succeed in transforming
the ugly little widow into a handsome woman. However,
Madame Rachel had her own way of producing love-letters,
and she showered them upon Mrs. Borradaile,
who believed that they all came from the peer who had
fallen in love with her at first sight.</p>

<p>Many of the letters were published in the papers
subsequently, and created astonishment and mirth.
It was never actually proved who wrote them, because
Madame Rachel always insisted upon taking the originals
from the widow, though allowing her to keep
copies.</p>

<p>One specimen of the curious correspondence will
suffice to show the sort of stuff Mrs. Borradaile was
willing to swallow. The term "granny" applies to
Madame Rachel, who bestowed this endearing term
upon herself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My only-dearly beloved Mary,</p>

<p><span class="in2">"The</span> little perfume-box and the pencil-case
belonged to my sainted mother. She died with them
in her hand. When she was a schoolgirl it was my
father's first gift to her. Granny has given the watch
and locket to me again. Your coronet is finished, my
love. Granny said you had answered my last letter,
but you have forgotten to send it. I forgot yesterday
was Ash Wednesday. Let old granny arrange the time,
as we have little to spare.</p>

<p>"My dearest one, what is the matter with the old
woman? She seems out of sorts. We must manage
to keep her in good temper for our own sakes, because
she has to manage all for us, and I should not have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the joy of your love had it not been for her. Darling
love, Mary, my sweet one, all will be well in a few hours.
The dispatches have arrived. I will let you know when
I hear from you, my heart's love. Bear up, my fond
one. I shall be at your feet&mdash;those pretty feet that
I love&mdash;and you may kick your ugly old donkey. Two
letters, naughty little pet, and you have not answered
one.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">"With fond and devoted love,</span><br />
<span class="l6">"Yours, until death,</span><br />
"William."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>All the letters, inspired, it is certain, by Madame
Rachel, were in this strain, and each one contained a
warning not to offend her.</p>

<p>The letters the peer was alleged to have written
also dropped hints that the woman's monetary demands
were to be met without hesitation, and by way of compensation
he was made to promise a fortune as well as
a title for his bride. Sometimes Lord Ranelagh's
letter requested Mrs. Borradaile to settle certain debts
he owed Madame Rachel, and so artfully interspersed
were his epistles with criticisms of her that Mrs. Borradaile
never guessed that they were all forgeries, and
very likely had been dictated by "granny" herself to
her daughters.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel's constant advice to Mrs. Borradaile
was to persevere with the treatment, and to start to
collect jewellery, because Lord Ranelagh loved diamonds
and pearls. The coronet mentioned in the letter
quoted never had any existence, although the swindler
was given eight hundred pounds to pay for it. She
told Mrs. Borradaile that she was minding it for her,
and the deluded woman accepted her assurance that
it was quite safe.</p>

<p>The beauty shop in New Bond Street became Mrs.
Borradaile's second home, because Madame Rachel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
insisted that she should not do anything without consulting
her. The widow was a gold mine to the adventuress.
She parted with her money readily and cheerfully.
Once Madame Rachel required two hundred
guineas for a certain purpose, and, as she did not wish
to draw a cheque on her own account, she told Mrs.
Borradaile that she must purchase a carriage for her
wedding, and have the Ranelagh arms painted upon
it. The simple-minded and trusting widow did as she
was told, but, of course, the carriage was never bought,
Madame Rachel utilizing the cheque for her own
needs.</p>

<p>It was the same with her trousseau. Mrs. Borradaile
chose it, and gave Madame Rachel the money to settle
with the tradespeople. Certain of the articles, having
been delivered, had to be paid for, but the creature
promptly pawned them all because they were of no use
to her.</p>

<p>In the course of some months Mrs. Borradaile had
bought and paid for jewellery, clothes, some choice
pieces of furniture, a coronet and a carriage, and she
was under the impression that Madame Rachel was
minding them all for her. That was not surprising,
seeing that when the swindler informed her that she
and Lord Ranelagh were to be married by proxy she
unhesitatingly accepted that extraordinary way of
becoming a peeress. But Mrs. Borradaile was so delighted
to think that some one had fallen in love with
her that she was eager to believe anything.</p>

<p>However, a worm will turn, and when Madame Rachel
had bled Mrs. Borradaile of nearly four thousand pounds
as well as securing promises in writing to pay as much
again, the widow suddenly woke up and consulted her
solicitor. That hardheaded man of the world had no
difficulty in proving to her that she had been the victim
of a scandalous swindle, and he counselled an appeal
to the law. Accordingly Madame Rachel was arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
on a charge of having obtained money by false pretences,
and was committed for trial at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>The trial was a notable one, and attracted crowds
to the court. Lord Ranelagh was given a seat on the
bench, and when called as a witness he denied having
met Mrs. Borradaile, and laughed at the idea that he
had written the letters, copies of which were exhibited
by the prosecution. Counsel for the defence cross-examined
severely, and Mrs. Borradaile had a rough
time at their hands, and as Madame Rachel noticed
that the case was going favourably for her she began
to assume a haughty attitude, reclining in the dock
like a tragedy queen, and sniffing scornfully whenever
any damaging statement was made by a witness for
the other side.</p>

<p>Considering the overwhelming nature of the evidence
for the prosecution it was a remarkable feat on the
part of Madame Rachel's counsel that they should
succeed in preventing the jury coming to a decision.
The twelve good men and true took five hours to argue
the case amongst themselves, and then had to announce
that they were unable to agree.</p>

<p>Madame Rachel's smile of triumph when the trial
was declared abortive was remarkable, and when the
judge ordered a new trial at the next sessions, and
assented to admitting the prisoner to bail, two sureties
at five thousand pounds each, the "beauty specialist"
had no difficulty in obtaining the necessary backing.</p>

<p>Her freedom, however, was destined to be short,
for the second trial&mdash;which took place on September
21-25, 1868&mdash;ended disastrously for her.</p>

<p>The prosecution, represented by Mr. Sergeant Ballantine
and Montague Williams and Douglas Straight,
advanced no new facts, relying upon a repetition of
the proof they had given at the first trial. But Madame
Rachel's clever array of lawyers&mdash;Digby Seymour,
Q.C., headed a legal team of four&mdash;were unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
hoodwink a jury again. On this occasion the twelve
men had no difficulty in arriving at an adverse decision,
unanimously finding the prisoner guilty after an extraordinary
summing-up by Mr. Commissioner Kerr. She
was white to the lips and shaking with fear when
she stood up to receive sentence of five years' penal
servitude, and she could not leave the dock without
the aid of the wardresses. The last the packed court
saw of the ugly old hag was a deathly white face and a
pair of black eyes gleaming unnaturally.</p>

<p>She served her time, and soon after her release, with
amazing impudence, started business again as a "beauty
specialist." Undeterred by previous experience, she
sought for another victim of the Borradaile type, and,
finding one, swindled her with cynical effrontery until
the dupe turned against her. Then followed another
trial for obtaining money and jewels by false pretences,
and again the sentence was five years' penal servitude.
Madame Rachel was convicted on April 11th, 1878,
and she died in prison.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MONTE CARLO TRUNK MURDERESS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">When</span> a young woman deliberately embarks
upon a career of crime she is certain of a
fair amount of success, provided she is
pretty enough to attract men to her side. A beauty,
however black her record may be, need never want for
male assistance. If she is clever and designing she can,
as a rule, lay her plans with such discretion that if
arrest follows she is able to plead that she was merely
the tool of a designing man.</p>

<p>The trick has succeeded nine times out of ten. Juries
naturally pity the "weaker sex," and at the Old Bailey
I have seen women let off with a few months' imprisonment
whilst their really less culpable partners in wrongdoing
have been sent to penal servitude for no other
reason than that they were of the masculine gender.
Thus, it will be admitted that the female criminal has
at least one advantage over her male colleague.</p>

<p>But Marie Goold never was a beauty. As a young
girl she was plain-looking and her manner repelled.
She made no friends, and the passage of time did not
bring any improvement in her appearance. She was
clever and resourceful, however, and when a desire to
mix in fashionable circles and to acquire riches quickly
determined her to turn criminal she relied solely on
her brains and not on her face. Yet she married three
times, and on each occasion above her own position,
and from first to last she always had at least one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
in tow who was completely dominated by her and obeyed
her implicitly.</p>

<p>Her first marriage was the result of pique on her
part. There was a youth in her native village&mdash;she
was born in France&mdash;who for some quaint reason fell
in love with her. He may have admired her vitriolic
tongue and her fearlessness, but the fact remains that
he proposed. Marie Girodin refused him, but the
youth did not tell his parents of his failure, and they,
in their anxiety to save him, began a campaign of
calumny against the "charmer." It was a fatal move
on their part, for Marie, just to spite them, married
their son and then discarded him, because she decided
that he could be of no use to her. He was wretched
and unhappy, but so hypnotized by his wife that when
she returned to him after a long absence he was almost
delirious with joy, and promptly handed over his savings.
Marie had been in Paris and London in the meantime,
but she only remained at home for three months. Her
husband died suddenly, and the widow immediately
went abroad again. It was perhaps merely a coincidence
that the young man expired just when Marie had made
up her mind that she would accept the gallant English
army officer who had been courting her under the
impression that she was free.</p>

<p>Once more Marie ventured on the matrimonial sea.
Her second marriage was an improvement on the first,
and for a while she was content to spend money and
enjoy herself. The captain's means, however, would
not stand the strain, and Marie left for a Continental
tour by herself. She stopped for a couple of days at
Nice and then departed; and when she had gone two
thousand pounds' worth of jewellery disappeared with
her. There was no proof of her guilt, and she was not
molested, but Marie's poverty ceased abruptly, and
for a few months she was able to indulge herself.</p>

<p>Then the captain died, for Marie had, curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
enough, grown very tired of him too. His ideas of
honour and honesty had disturbed her. She knew that
he sternly disapproved of theft and forgery, and to
obtaining money by false pretences&mdash;one of her little
hobbies&mdash;the captain was fanatically opposed. Therefore,
his death came as a welcome release to her. Black
suited her, and if money was scarce she had a collection
of jewellery which was her precaution against a "rainy
day."</p>

<p>She was now nearer thirty than twenty, and it required
all the art of which she was capable to make
herself presentable. Her face was thin and marked,
her eyes were black and repellent, and her skin sallow.
People shrank from her until she began to talk, for
then her rippling voice poured forth stories of adventures
in which names of famous men and women in France
and Great Britain appeared with her own.</p>

<p>Strangers were impressed by her. She never asserted
that she was on intimate terms with Presidents and
Cabinet Ministers, but she inferred it, and the credulous
crowded round her. Once she got them interested she
held them. She was clever enough to be able to do that.</p>

<p>But talking did not produce money, and Marie, who
owed thousands, began to feel a draught. She did not
ask for loans. Such a procedure would be tantamount
to suicide, but she resorted to trickery to replenish her
purse. Thus she flattered and coaxed an English
lady into giving her the position of secretary-companion.
Marie protested that she only wanted companionship
herself, and that she would not accept a salary, as
she had plenty of money lying at her bankers. The
English woman, captivated by her chatter, agreed, and
a few weeks later was lamenting the loss of six hundred
pounds which had "gone astray" while she and her
"companion-secretary" were travelling to San Sebastian.</p>

<p>The day after the disaster Marie told her that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
had been summoned to Paris to consult her lawyers
about some property left to her by her husband. She
parted from her employer with tears in her eyes, but
she did not go to the French capital. She fixed upon
Marseilles, and, taking up her headquarters in the
leading hotel there, had a riotous time on the money
she had stolen from the English lady.</p>

<p>The six hundred pounds and Marie were soon separated,
and once more she was penniless. She still had her
jewellery, but she was loath to sell it, and in desperation
she set on foot various swindles. They all came to
nothing, and at last, feeling that the police were watching
her, she became panic-stricken, and fled to London.
They could not harm her there, as she was, by virtue
of her second marriage, a British subject.</p>

<p>In London she was friendless, while hotel managers
were hard-hearted and would allow no credit. Poor
Marie was compelled to work, and, of course, she hated
the prospect, but necessity compelled her to dispose
of her jewellery, and with the money to start a dressmaker's
establishment. She found a coy-looking shop
in an unobtrusive street in the West End of London,
and with a small and select stock began her new career.</p>

<p>The woman, a criminal to the finger-tips, utterly
unscrupulous and merciless, had no intention of settling
down to the drudgery of a dressmaker's life. She
regarded her establishment as a spider must regard his
web. Money was not to be earned legitimately, but
by trickery. Money and more money was all Marie
thought of, and, with the aid of her crafty tongue, she
extracted various sums from trusting and sympathetic
clients.</p>

<p>She could ingratiate herself into the confidences of
middle-aged English ladies who were losing their attractions
by grossly flattering them, and, because she
was no rival so far as looks were concerned, they became
friends of hers rather than clients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Her first exploit in London was a great success. A
well-to-do woman of fifty, who had been fascinated by
"Madame's" promise to keep her young, called to see
her, and found the dressmaker in tears. The usual
question ensued, and then Marie whispered that the
broker's men were in the next room, and that she was
ruined. The sympathetic customer paid the amount
which Marie said was owing, and as the whole story was
a lie the "dressmaker" was sixty pounds to the good.</p>

<p>Hitherto Marie's criminal activities had centred on
obtaining money by means of fraud. Her first two
husbands may have died under suspicious circumstances,
but it was only suspicion after all, and it was not until
she was a British subject and a resident in the West
End of London that she soared to greater criminal
heights.</p>

<p>The widow began to think of marrying again. A
husband would be decidedly useful in London. The
English were inclined to regard her with suspicion
because she had no man attached to her, and Marie
meant to abandon the dressmaking business because
the comparatively small sums which she obtained from
confiding customers were of little use to her. She
wanted thousands now, for she had become a confirmed
gambler, and the luck as a rule went against her. She
therefore, as a preliminary, commenced a campaign to
find a husband, and she had not to wait long for
success.</p>

<p>It was said at the time of the final catastrophe that
Marie first met Vere Goold when the latter called to
pay an account for a relative, but there was no confirmation
of this, and there is reason to believe that
she made his acquaintance at a restaurant in the West
End.</p>

<p>Vere Goold was an Irishman of good family, who
devoted his time to absorbing intoxicating liquors.
A man of education and some ability, drink and drugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
had robbed him of all his will power. He had been sent
to London by friends and relations who were anxious
for him to reform, and they made him a small allowance,
hoping that he would find it impossible to live on it,
and would, therefore, seek some form of employment.</p>

<p>Goold, however, was content to take the part of
the shabby genteel "loafer," and for some years he
was well known in most of the taprooms in the West End.
When he was in funds he was in the habit of entertaining
acquaintances in one of the cheap Soho restaurants,
but these rare appearances in the rôle of host were
invariably marked by ejection from the particular
restaurant. Now and then he paid a small fine at
Marlborough Street for being "drunk and disorderly,"
but on the whole Vere Goold had only one enemy, and
that was himself. He was otherwise quite inoffensive
until he came into the life of the adventuress.</p>

<p>The moment she decided to become Vere Goold's
wife there was no way of escape for him. The woman
was a human snake, and he was the frightened, timid
rabbit. She dosed him with liquor and did all the
thinking for him. When she led him to the nearest
register office he plaintively said "Yes" to everything,
and it took his drink-soddened mind some hours to
realize that he was a married man, the husband of
Marie, the woman with the evil face and the tongue
of honey.</p>

<p>Marie Goold was delighted with her third husband.
She compiled a list of his relatives, most of them of
good social position, and, what was more important,
she discovered there was a baronetcy in the family,
and that if only certain persons died her husband would
succeed to it and she would become Lady Goold! Ambition
and vanity caused her to make her husband
assume the baronetcy. By now the dressmaking business
had been disposed of, and the married couple had
about a hundred pounds between them. Marie voted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
for a protracted honeymoon on the Continent, and,
to lend distinction to their adventures, it was as Sir
Vere and Lady Goold that they left London for Paris,
"her ladyship" plentifully stocked with clothes which
she had obtained from the wholesale houses without
troubling to pay for them.</p>

<p>But when their funds vanished they experienced many
vicissitudes of fortune, and Vere Goold, who waited
on his wife like a slave, came in for much abuse. He
would listen meekly to her upbraidings, and then wander
forth, hoping to meet an acquaintance on the boulevards
whom he might "tap" for a few francs. They were
turned out of several hotels and boarding-houses. Once
Goold borrowed a little money and gave it to Marie.
She promptly took a room at an hotel, and as the manager
insisted upon cash down, even for their meals, she let
her husband go without food, whilst she enjoyed the
excellent cuisine of the hotel.</p>

<p>They experienced occasional bursts of sunshine when
Marie succeeded in extracting loans from confiding
hotel acquaintances, but the inevitable sequel to these
minor triumphs was flight to escape prosecution for
fraud. The helpless husband followed her about like
a tame dog, and when she told him that she had found
a way out of all their troubles he believed her, and
declared his acquiescence in everything she said and did.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that Marie Goold was a gambler,
and in the darkest hour she remembered Monte Carlo.
She was positive that she knew the way to break the
bank. Given a little capital, she was confident that
she would make them both rich beyond the dreams of
avarice.</p>

<p>The adventuress craved for big money now. For
years she had lived by her wits, and the result was
misery, mental and physical. She had swindled scores
of acquaintances, and it was hardly safe for her to
appear in London, Paris and other cities. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that the police of several countries had her name on
their books, and for all her cleverness she had nothing
to show except a weak-minded drunkard of a husband
and her own ill-nourished condition. But she felt
certain that Monte Carlo would prove their salvation.
It was her last hope. She had expended all other
sources of income, and now everything would depend
on her cleverness as a gambler and the system she had
invented.</p>

<p>For ten days they were held up in Paris owing to
lack of funds, but Vere Goold wrote pitiful letters to
friends in England, and a few of them responded, while
Marie, making the most of her assumed title of "Lady
Goold," obtained on approval a diamond ring from a
jeweller. She was to have it on approval for twenty-four
hours, and then, if she decided to keep it, was to
pay cash down. But before the twenty-four hours
elapsed the ring was pawned and she and the "baronet"
were in the express for the Riviera, exulting over the
good time coming. She had worked out an infallible
system with which she could smash the bank, and henceforth
they were&mdash;so she assured him&mdash;to have no difficulty
in living up to their "baronetcy."</p>

<p>Marie was so anxious to keep as much of her small
store of money as possible for the tables in the Casino
that she became economically minded, and, instead
of going to an hotel, took apartments in a Villa. She
sent for her niece to act as a sort of housekeeper, because
she would have to spend her days in the gaming-rooms.
The niece, who was only twenty-four, was delighted to
accept the invitation. She had not experienced much
pleasure in her life, and the prospect of a season at
Monte Carlo enchanted her.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to guess Marie Goold's experiences
as a would-be breaker of the bank at Monte Carlo. The
"infallible system," which had worked out so well
on paper, proved a delusion and a snare, and Marie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
returned from the Casino in a towering rage with everybody.
For hours her husband had patiently waited
outside the Casino to accompany her home. He was
not allowed to enter by his strong-minded wife, who
had ordered him to hang about outside until she was
tired of playing. Vere Goold would have willingly
allowed her to use him as a door mat, and he was quite
content to take her to the Casino and remain in the
grounds until she was ready for him. He had a vague
idea that his clever wife would overcome all difficulties,
for he believed her to be a genius.</p>

<p>Four visits to the Casino resulted in Marie being
penniless again. The position was desperate. They
had obtained the rooms at the Villa Menesimy without
the formality of rent in advance or references, the landlord
having been overwhelmed by the honour of "Sir
Vere and Lady Goold's" acquaintance. Nevertheless,
at the end of the month he would demand what was
owing, and the sum was so small that inability to pay
it would arouse his suspicions, and then they would
have to fly from Monte Carlo, and Marie would be
unable to test her system further. But she refused to
admit that her system was faulty. Her reverses she
put down to sheer bad luck.</p>

<p>Marie had to search Monte Carlo for a likely victim
to provide funds. In this way precious hours were
wasted. She told her husband that she ought to be
at the Casino coining money instead of lunching as
cheaply as possible in expensive hotels and restaurants,
but it was necessary for the vulture to go after her
prey, and the loss of time could not be helped.</p>

<p>She achieved her object with characteristic cunning.
One afternoon she "accidentally" stumbled against a
lady in the hall of an hotel, and instantly apologized
very humbly. From apology to general conversation
was an easy step, and the stranger was fascinated by
Marie's ready tongue. When they had made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
names known to one another, "Lady Goold" begged
to be allowed to present her husband "Sir Vere," to
Madame Levin, and the latter, who was the widow of
a wealthy Stockholm merchant, gladly accorded permission.
She had social ambitions, and she welcomed
"Sir Vere and Lady Goold" with more than ordinary
cordiality. Marie, fashionably dressed and with her
sallow cheeks lightened by a skilful use of powder, deferred
in the most alluring manner to the rich widow.
That she was wealthy was obvious from her display of
jewellery, for Madame Levin carried thousands of
pounds worth with her and frankly invited the admiration
of strangers.</p>

<p>Marie Goold thought that Madame Levin would
prove a source of income, and she was, therefore, surprised
and exasperated when she discovered that the
lady was close-fisted. Instead of obtaining hundreds
it took Marie a fortnight to borrow forty pounds from
her rich friend, and in return for that small loan she
had to bow and scrape to her, and agree with everything
she said. In fact, the clever adventuress had
to subordinate her own opinions to the clumsily-expressed
and frequently irritating statements to which
the widow gave vent.</p>

<p>Her experiences leading up to the borrowing of that
forty pounds should have convinced her that Madame
Levin would prove a worrying creditor. The loan
eventually passed into the keeping of the owner of the
Casino, and Marie once again had to try and "raise
the wind."</p>

<p>It maddened her to think that Monte Carlo was
crowded with wealthy persons of both sexes on whom
she was unable to practise any of her money-raising
tricks, simply because they would not have anything
to do with her. "Sir Vere and Lady Goold" were
for some unexplained reason at a discount, and squabbles
and hysteria were of frequent occurrence at the Villa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Menesimy when Marie came back from the gaming-tables
without a sou.</p>

<p>Then Madame Levin began to press for repayment,
and when her debtor pleaded temporary embarrassment
owing to non-receipt of a large remittance from
her husband's agent in London she showed her teeth.
Clearly Madame Levin regarded forty pounds as a
very large sum, and she pestered "Lady Goold" every
time they met. The adventuress was at her wit's
end. She had to look pleasant and chat amiably with
the rich widow, and ignore her insults, and yet she
longed to get her white hands round the throat of her
persecutor. She hated the Stockholm widow with a
ferocity that was akin to madness, for Madame Levin
was angrily demanding payment of the debt while
Marie was actually in want of money to buy the
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The two women had a violent quarrel, and Marie
must have unconsciously revealed something of her
real self, for Madame Levin became afraid of her. Perhaps
she saw murder in the evil eyes of the adventuress.
She had been told already that Marie Goold was not
entitled to the prefix "Lady," and from a trustworthy
source she had ascertained that they were a couple of
needy adventurers with a very shady and shadowy past.</p>

<p>After that Madame Levin seldom saw her, though
she continued to write angry letters asking for the return
of her money. Marie Goold ignored these appeals
and threats. She was too absorbed in her own immediate
difficulties now. Even poor Vere Goold, that
helpless incompetent, was feeling the strain. For
some days he was actually obliged to keep sober owing
to the shortage of ready money.</p>

<p>Every day made matters worse. The Casino was
not mentioned, and the Goolds were living in dire
poverty, chained to the Villa Menesimy by their penniless
condition. Then it was that the wolfish woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
thought out the second great plan which she declared
could save them.</p>

<p>She did not condescend to take her husband into her
fullest confidence, but she gave him an outline of her
latest plans. He agreed, of course. It was too late
now for this weak-minded sot to try and emancipate
his soul from the thraldom of his domineering wife,
and as usual he was content to leave everything to her.</p>

<p>The first move was to get Marie's niece to spend a
couple of days away from the apartments in the Villa
Menesimy. This was accomplished easily. Then Marie
called on Madame Levin with a smile and an apology,
and asked her to come to the Villa Menesimy on the
following Sunday to have tea with herself and her
husband, and receive the forty pounds to which she
was entitled.</p>

<p>Madame Levin hesitated. She disliked Vere Goold,
the victim of drink and drugs, and she was afraid of
Mrs. Goold, who was obviously a person who would
stick at nothing. But when Marie emphasized her
willingness to settle her debt the widow forgot her fears.
She had arranged to leave Monte Carlo within a few
days, and she was anxious to recover her forty pounds
before she took her departure.</p>

<p>The Sunday came, and at half-past four Madame
Levin entered the apartments the Goolds occupied
at the Villa Menesimy. She was never seen alive again,
for Marie Goold in inviting her to tea did so to take
her life. Vere Goold, his faculties paralysed by drugs,
opened the door to Madame Levin, and presently Marie
emerged from the kitchen to greet her and to explain
laughingly that her niece had been called away, and
that she was compelled to prepare the tea herself.
She placed a chair for her visitor, and returned to the
kitchen, whilst Vere Goold, his whole body trembling,
sat facing Madame Levin, trying to make conversation.</p>

<p>The widow forgot her doubts and fears, and chatted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
brightly to the accompaniment of the pleasant jingle
of tea-things from the kitchen. Goold mumbled answers
to her remarks, but the widow thought that his nervousness
and distracted condition were due to drink
and drugs, and she did her best to put him at his ease.</p>

<p>The noise in the kitchen ceased abruptly, but Madame
Levin did not turn her head. She talked on of her
home in Stockholm and of her future plans, and her
voice was the only one heard as Marie Goold crept from
the kitchen with a formidable-looking poker in her
right hand. Madame Levin's back was towards the
kitchen door, and she never heard the footfalls of her
murderess.</p>

<p>Vere Goold sprang to his feet as the poker was raised
by his wife and brought down with terrific force upon
the head of the unfortunate visitor. She collapsed
without a sound, and then Marie finished her off with a
knife, her husband looking on dazed and stupefied.</p>

<p>She roused him with an oath, and, realizing that they
were both in danger, he worked as she commanded.
They had a big trunk in the bedroom, and this was
hauled out. A large carpet-bag was found which
could hold the head and legs of the murdered woman,
and the rest of the corpse was packed in the trunk.</p>

<p>Late that night the niece returned, and she noticed
at once that the carpet and curtains of the sitting-room
were splashed with blood, but her aunt anticipated
questions by informing her that her uncle had had a
fit, during which he had vomited blood.</p>

<p>The next evening&mdash;the murder took place on Sunday,
August 4, 1907&mdash;the guilty couple prepared for flight.
They could not leave the trunk and the carpet-bag
behind them, and they took both with them, Goold
carrying the latter. The trunk was conveyed in a cab
to the railway station, and tickets taken for Marseilles.</p>

<p>They arrived at their destination in the early hours
of Tuesday morning, and Goold immediately ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the trunk to be labelled "Charing Cross, London,"
and despatched there. Then with his wife he went to
an hotel for rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>It was now the duty of the goods clerk at Marseilles
Station to attend to the trunk, but when he came near
it he was surprised by a fearful odour. Closer examination
proved that blood was oozing from beneath the
lid. Pons&mdash;that was the clerk's name&mdash;went at once
to the hotel and saw the Goolds. They explained that
the trunk was filled with poultry, hence the blood,
but the railway official was not satisfied, and he called
at a police station, where the inspector instructed him
to inform the Goolds that the trunk would not be allowed
to leave Marseilles until it had been opened and
the contents examined in their presence.</p>

<p>Pons's first visit to the hotel had aroused doubts in
Marie's mind, and she told her husband to get ready
to steal out of Marseilles. He quickly obeyed, and
they were actually emerging from the hotel when the
goods clerk arrived for the second time. He conveyed
to them the decision of the police, and Marie, conscious
that they were in a tight corner, staked her life on bluff.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said haughtily, "we will take a
cab and drive to the station, and when you have opened
the trunk you can apologize for having been so impertinent
as to doubt my word." The cab was called, and
Marie and her husband with the large carpet-bag got
in, but the woman's heart must have sunk when Pons
entered after them, as though they were under arrest
already.</p>

<p>The cab rattled along, and no one spoke until Mrs.
Goold clutched the clerk's arm and whispered to him
that she would be willing to pay ten thousand francs
if he would let them go. Pons sat immovable. He
was not to be bribed, and the attempt to do so proved
that his suspicions were well-founded.</p>

<p>The examination of the contents of the trunk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
carpet-bag indicated that a brutal murder had been
committed, and before the two prisoners had time to
confess the police identified the victim, and unravelled
the whole story. Marie and her husband were accordingly
sent back to Monte Carlo to stand their trial.</p>

<p>The woman was the chief figure in Court, her husband
always presenting a shivering, weak-kneed appearance
in the dock. Marie Goold was clearly the person who
had murdered Madame Levin, and the sentence in her
case was death. Her husband was consigned to penal
servitude for life.</p>

<p>After a sensational trial they were removed to the
French prison at Cayenne, and there in July, 1908,
Marie Goold died of typhoid fever. Fourteen months
later Vere Goold, driven insane by remorse and the
deprivation of drink and drugs, committed suicide.</p>

<p>The fate of the niece was pathetic. She was so upset
by her association with the murderers that despite
every attention she faded away, dying before she attained
her twenty-seventh birthday.</p>

<span class="subhead">MARTHA KUPFER, SWINDLER</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">The</span> European War produced many German
criminals, but the most resourceful of them
all was Martha Kupfer, a middle-aged widow
with a plausible manner and a pretty daughter, whose
only capital was a profound knowledge of the weaknesses
of her compatriots, out of which she made over £200,000
before she was arrested. She obtained this fortune in
less than a couple of years, and there is every reason to
believe that had she not grown careless she would never
have been detected.</p>

<p>Anybody who is conversant with the German people
must be aware that they worship three gods&mdash;Food,
Money and Decorations. Every Hun before the war
would have sold his soul for a medal, and although the
ex-Kaiser cheapened the Iron Cross and similar gew-gaws
by his lavish and ridiculous bestowal of them, they
are still prized in Prussia.</p>

<p>When the Allies proclaimed a blockade of Germany,
they incidentally turned the thoughts of all true Huns
to food, not only because they are the heaviest, grossest
and coarsest eaters in Europe, but because the rising
prices clearly indicated an easy way to wealth for speculators.
Money and food, therefore, were supreme, and
decorations were temporarily forgotten.</p>

<p>An elderly Bavarian four years ago, summed up the
situation neatly: "There are two things a German
cannot escape&mdash;Death and the Iron Cross." He got
six months in gaol for his humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Frau Kupfer, a stoutish little woman with a smiling
face and large blue eyes, was one of the many who
pondered over the situation. She was poor, and struggling
hard to make both ends meet, and she listened with
envy and attention to the various stories her neighbours
told of the fortunes dealers in food were accumulating.
They all wished they had the opportunity to share in
their profits, and they spoke wistfully of money invested
in banks and insurance companies which were paying
miserably small dividends whilst corn dealers and grocers
were turning their capital over in less than a month!</p>

<p>As the woman watched the bloated faces grow red and
the dull eyes light up with greed, she realized that if
only she could persuade them to believe that she had the
power to buy and import provisions on wholesale lines
and retail them at exorbitant prices to the community
they would gladly entrust her with their savings, and she
and her daughter would have a good time and never want
again.</p>

<p>This was in the early part of 1915, when Martha Kupfer
was living in a poverty-stricken flat in Leipzig. She
thought the matter over for some days, and at last decided
to enter upon a swindling career. She was certain
that she had found a royal road to riches, and believing
that she would do better in the metropolis she made
preparations to live in Berlin.</p>

<p>But she had first to raise at least a hundred pounds to
pay her expenses. It would not do to begin without
capital, for if she looked poor she would not be able to
influence the well-to-do, and she had, therefore, to try her
hand in her native town. Frau Kupfer's first exploit
was characteristic. She went to the widow of a doctor
whom she knew to have a considerable sum in the bank,
and she told her a wonderful story of how Wertheim,
the great Berlin merchant, had sent for her to act as
buyer for his grocery department because she had special
facilities for getting the Danish farmers to sell cheaply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
to her. She added that she was to have half the profits,
and she finally persuaded the old lady to part with five
hundred pounds by promising that every month she
would receive from her interest amounting to fifty
pounds! This was at the rate of 120 per cent per annum!
The doctor's widow was too good a German to be able
to resist the temptation. She handed over the money,
and Frau Kupfer and her daughter went to Berlin to
start the great campaign.</p>

<p>Thanks to the capital provided by the credulous widow,
Frau Kupfer was in a position to rent an expensive flat
close to the one-time palatial building known as the
British Embassy. Then she did a little shopping, and
the outcome of this was that her neighbours&mdash;and Germans
are renowned for their curiosity&mdash;began to babble
excitedly about the fashionably-dressed widow and her
daughter, who were obviously persons of great wealth.</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer and Gertrude wore the latest gowns, and
their hats were wonderful. Every morning a beautifully-appointed
motor-car took them for drives, and the two
servants&mdash;being patriotic, she restricted herself to a
couple&mdash;exhibited to their friends, when their mistress
was out, cards bearing the names of some of the greatest
personages in Berlin. Princesses, countesses, generals,
admirals, and hosts of the nobility, learned professors,
and several millionaire business men and their wives
appeared to be on calling terms with the new-comers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frau Kupfer and Gertrude went their own
way, seeking no acquaintances, but always charming and
good-tempered and charitable.</p>

<p>The fact was that Frau Kupfer knew that to attract
people one must appear not to want them. They must
come to the gilded parlour of their own accord, but until
she was quite ready to swindle them she must pretend
not to be anxious to extend her "large circle of acquaintances."
It seems unnecessary to add that the
cards which so impressed the servants were fakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Curiously enough, it was a doctor who started the ball
rolling in Berlin. About this time the Berlin newspapers
were full of fictitious stories of German victories on land
and sea. Twice already it had been reported that Zeppelins
had wiped London out of existence, and the daily
boast of the papers was that Great Britain had ceased to
rule the waves, her ships having been destroyed by the
gallant German Navy.</p>

<p>But while the Huns believed anything they wished to
believe these flattering reports did not make bread and
meat more plentiful, and the food difficulties were increasing
instead of diminishing. Only a few persons
wondered how it was that London could have been
rebuilt between the first and second Zeppelin raids.
The majority accepted each lie with delightful simplicity.
But only the rich experienced no privations, and Frau
Kupfer and pretty Fraulein Gertrude were apparently
very well off, for they, at any rate, did not want for the
necessaries or the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>One morning, however, Frau Kupfer pretended that
she had a headache, and she summoned by telephone a
Dr. Richter, a physician who has one of the largest and
most fashionable practices in Berlin. Now the doctor,
being a near neighbour of the Kupfers, had heard the
rumours of their wealth, and he obeyed the summons
with alacrity. He found Frau Kupfer charming and
amiable, apologizing a dozen times for giving him so
much trouble, and murmuring that she was suffering
from overwork.</p>

<p>The doctor was sympathetic, and when Gertrude
brought him some refreshment he was only too eager
to linger over it as his patient chattered. He was curious
to discover the secret of her wealth, and as she talked
volubly Frau Kupfer "unconsciously" gave him the
desired information.</p>

<p>"My agents in Denmark," she said, with a wan smile,
"are angry with me because I can't take all the food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
they have bought on my account. You see, <i>Herr Doctor</i>,
I lived for many years in Denmark, and when the
war broke out and those terrible English began their
blockade it occurred to me that I could help my beloved
country by importing food from Denmark, especially as
I have unique facilities, owing to the largest farmers being
related to me. I didn't mean to make money, but I
find that the shops in Berlin are so anxious to buy that
they will pay any price. I can turn my capital over ten
times a month.</p>

<p>"It seems that there are enormous profits waiting to
be picked up, but I haven't the necessary capital. I am
quite content, but my agents think I am foolish not to
raise another hundred thousand pounds and make as
much a month by using it. You have no idea the money
that can be coined, but, of course, one must know how to
work it." She laid a hand on the doctor's arm and looked
at him appealingly. "I have spoken candidly, because
I know I can trust you, <i>Herr Doctor</i>," she added, in a
musical undertone. "You won't tell your friends, will
you? I am only a widow, and I don't want to be bothered.
I am quite content with the present profits, they
will enable me to complete my darling child's education
and give her a large dowry when she marries."</p>

<p>The doctor hastened to assure her that her secret was
safe with him. Then he took his departure, and it
happened that his next patient was Countess von Hohn,
the wife of General Count von Hohn, an aide-de-camp
to the Kaiser, and a first cousin of Prince von Bülow, the
ex-Chancellor. To her the doctor revealed the great
secret, knowing that the countess loved money better than
life itself. As he anticipated he fired her imagination,
and she instantly commanded him to bring about a
meeting between herself and the wonderful Frau Kupfer.</p>

<p>"I have twenty thousand pounds lying idle at my
banker's," she said, and in her excitement she forgot that
she was ill, and began to walk up and down the apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
"Frau Kupfer, you say, can turn it into forty
thousand within three months? I must see her at once.
<i>Herr Doctor</i>, send your wife to call on her, and after
that, when she's at your house, you can ring me up on
the telephone, and I will hasten round. If this war
goes on against Germany, it behoves us to have something
to fall back upon. Everybody knows that dealers
in provisions are amassing fortunes. Why shouldn't
I have some of the profits too?"</p>

<p>Of course there was no difficulty in effecting an introduction
to Frau Kupfer. The two met at Dr. Richter's
house at afternoon tea, and Countess von Hohn made
herself very charming to the widow, whose dress and
jewellery must have cost a small fortune. Indeed,
they became so cordial that, although this was their
first meeting, the countess willingly accepted an invitation
to call at Frau Kupfer's flat the following afternoon.</p>

<p>When she arrived she was shown into the magnificently
furnished drawing-room, and there she was purposely
left alone for a few minutes. During that time the
inquisitive, money-mad woman searched the room for
signs of wealth. There were many to be found.</p>

<p>On the mantelpiece was a letter from the manager of
the Deutsche Bank acknowledging a deposit of sixty
thousand pounds; on a costly desk was a letter from
another bank informing Frau Kupfer that their Copenhagen
correspondents had advised them to place to her
credit one hundred and eleven pounds. Other papers
and letters were in the same strain, and when the countess
had mastered their contents she was positively
trembling with anxiety to get a finger in the financial
pie belonging to her newly-made friend.</p>

<p>It was against all etiquette for the countess to be left
unattended in the drawing-room, but when Frau Kupfer,
clothed in a glorious tea-gown, fluttered in and began to
apologize most profusely and extravagantly for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
neglect and rudeness, the countess, who would in any
other circumstances have been furious, hastened to
reassure her.</p>

<p>"These are war-times, Frau Kupfer," she said, with a
smile, "and we can afford to dispense with etiquette.
I assure you I have not been sorry for the opportunity to
inspect your beautiful furniture and pictures."</p>

<p>Martha Kupfer smiled in acknowledgment, but she
knew what her visitor had been doing. One glance had
told her that the letters on the table and the mantelpiece
had been touched. They were not in the same position
that she had left them in. Her little ruse had succeeded,
for she had purposely baited the room with these letters
and given the countess plenty of time to read them.</p>

<p>Tea was served, and a short time was spent in conversation,
in which Gertrude Kupfer discreetly joined, but
at the right moment she made an excuse and went out.</p>

<p>The countess was relieved. She had been unable to
touch any of the expensive cakes owing to her anxiety
to get to business. The moment Gertrude had gone she
mentioned the subject uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>"My dear Frau Kupfer," she said, in her most winning
manner, "I want you to promise not to be angry with
me if I ask you to let me invest twenty thousand pounds
in your little provision enterprise."</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer started and looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I feel as if we had known one another for years;
you can trust me," she added, appealingly.</p>

<p>But the swindler did not speak, and the countess
proceeded:</p>

<p>"I am sure you need capital. Why not let me help?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Frau Kupfer looked up at her.</p>

<p>"You are right, countess," she said, with a charming
blush. "It would be selfish of me to deny my friends a
share of the profits. I will take your money, and you
shall have ten per cent on it every month. I am making
that and more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
"Do you know that I can import bacon, for which
the people of Berlin pay eight shillings a pound for less
than a shilling a pound? The profits on flour are bigger,
and I can get a hundred per cent on soap and candles,
and practically everything of which the English are
trying to deprive us. I have a contract to supply three
palaces of the Kaiser's with provisions for a year. You
see, I am protected in high quarters. Of course, His
Majesty is paying the highest price for the very best,
and on that contract alone I shall make thirty shillings
profit on every pound I spend. I liked you countess,
from the moment we met. You shall have a share. It
is a pity you have not more money saved, because that
would mean a bigger return. However, you can reinvest
your dividends."</p>

<p>Within forty-eight hours the twenty thousand pounds
which the Countess von Hohn had received by the sale
of her British and French securities was in the hands of
Frau Kupfer.</p>

<p>I should mention that six weeks before the war started
the German Foreign Minister notified all those who could
be trusted to keep the secret that they had better realize
their investments in Great Britain, France and Russia.
As the countess' husband was one of the inner set, he got
the information early, and was able to save his own and
his wife's fortune.</p>

<p>This unexpected windfall delighted Frau Kupfer and
Gertrude. The first thing they did was to send fifty
pounds' "interest" to the doctor's widow at Leipzig,
and the second to take a larger and better flat,
retaining their original residence, however, and using
it mainly as a hiding-place for the choicest provisions.</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer paid her two maids lavishly and fed them
luxuriously, and they were hers body and soul in a city
where famine threatened to stalk abroad. It was easy,
therefore, to stock the flat with preserves, bacon, ham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
wines, cigars, cigarettes and soap, besides a huge amount
of clothing.</p>

<p>The stock was replenished from time to time, while
now that their headquarters were at one of the finest
flats in Berlin, Frau Kupfer and Gertrude were able
to proceed from financial triumph to social triumph.</p>

<p>Countess von Hohn was promptly paid her first dividend
of two thousand pounds a month after she had
invested her money, but she promptly sent the cheque
back with a request that it might be added to her
capital.</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer must have screamed with laughter when
she read this proof of how complete was her power over
her first great dupe. She was, indeed, succeeding beyond
her wildest dreams.</p>

<p>The widow at Leipzig also helped considerably, for
she wrote to a rich and highly placed friend in Berlin
about her luck, and that friend promptly called on Frau
Kupfer, and begged to be permitted to invest in the great
food trust. She found the woman entertaining half a
dozen ladies, all of whom bore names that were household
words in the country, and when she rather pettishly
complained of being bothered she did not resent her
manner, but became more supplicating than ever, and
eventually went away poorer by a thousand pounds,
which she had "invested."</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer was now fairly launched on a career of
gigantic swindling. It was no longer necessary to pretend
that she had tens of thousands of pounds at her
bankers. It was a fact. The money simply poured in
upon her every day.</p>

<p>All sorts and conditions of people clamoured to be
allowed to join the secret food trust. They quite understood
that everything had to be done quietly. The
common people, who had no inkling of the tremendous
profits that were being made by speculators in food,
must be kept in ignorance lest they should complain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and the horrible Socialist papers make trouble for the
profiteers.</p>

<p>Besides, as Frau Kupfer said, they must not forget that
they were all partners in a scheme that was daily contravening
the Government regulations as to maximum
prices.</p>

<p>Thus the times were in her favour. The war
dominated everybody's thoughts, and food was so scarce
that it ceased to be a question of prices. All were
willing to pay provided they obtained the provisions,
and so with the necessity for secrecy and the blind,
unquestioning obedience and trustfulness of her clients,
Frau Kupfer's position seemed impregnable.</p>

<p>Six months after her arrival in Berlin Frau Kupfer
launched out as a woman of fashion and means. She
went everywhere. The nobility received her, and she
was the constant companion of aristocratic dames,
who gave her and her daughter seats in their boxes
at the theatre.</p>

<p>No one could rival them in the art of dressing. It
was the talk of fashionable Berlin that Frau Kupfer
and Gertrude paid eighteen shillings a pair for stockings,
and never wore them twice, and that they had the
most expensive wardrobe in Germany. The swindler
maintained the deception by giving dinners, for which
the élite scrambled to obtain invitations. The very
rarest dishes and vintages were provided for her guests,
and despite food restrictions Frau Kupfer could entertain
as though there was not a war on and the British
blockade a myth.</p>

<p>There might be food riots in Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg
and scores of other places, but the friends of the
swindler never wanted for anything, and Frau Kupfer's
dinners were her best protection against exposure.
She was a charming hostess, and her sympathetic
interest in the relatives of her guests who were in the
trenches was enchanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
One of her most profitable deals arose out of her
pretended interest in the son of a retired general who
was introduced to her by the Countess von Hohn.
General von Demidoff, a German of Polish extraction,
was known to be a rich man. He had served for fifty
years in the army, and had spent at least half that time
enriching himself at the expense of the troops under
him.</p>

<p>But although he must have had plenty of cash he
did not succumb to Frau Kupfer's scheme as quickly
as she expected. General von Demidoff&mdash;he won the
coveted "von" in the Franco-Prussian War&mdash;was
an old man, and he was reluctant to engage in hazardous
speculation, but he was greatly pleased with Frau
Kupfer and her daughter.</p>

<p>The arch-swindler never even hinted that he should
take shares in the secret food trust, and as he got many
luxurious dinners at her expense he was only too glad
to number her amongst his acquaintances. They often
met at the theatre or at the house of a mutual friend,
and it was even rumoured that the old man was keen
on the wealthy widow; but this was only an invention.
Frau Kupfer had no desire for matrimony. She was
aware that marriage would inevitably lead to the discovery
of her colossal frauds.</p>

<p>But when Frau Kupfer began to talk about the
general's son, and to ask permission to send him parcels
of dainties, which she knew he could not obtain for
himself, he thought that a woman with such a kind
heart must be amongst the best of her sex, and although
he took a month to make up his mind he finally decided
to entrust ten thousand pounds to her for investment
in her business.</p>

<p>When he called on her with this intention he found
her reclining gracefully on a sofa reading, in the <i>Lokalanzeiger</i>,
an account of the victory of the Crown Prince's
Army at Verdun. Her eyes were shining with enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and she was all smiles when General von Demidoff
was announced.</p>

<p>For quite ten minutes she would not permit a word
of business to pass his lips. He had to have a drink
first&mdash;she had his favourite beverage ready in a few
seconds&mdash;and then there was a variety of sandwiches
for his delectation. The old soldier was always ready
to eat, and he was feeling particularly pleased with
himself, when he suddenly told his hostess that he
wished to hand her ten thousand pounds for investment.</p>

<p>He made the announcement as though he were conferring
a favour on her, and his amazement was all
the greater when with a charming smile she coyly refused
to accept his offer, explaining that she had all the
capital she required, and that the "dear general" had
better leave his money where it was.</p>

<p>He went away profoundly puzzled, little realizing
that Frau Kupfer was actually gasping for money.
She had run through tens of thousands of pounds.
Certain wealthy investors had, much to her disappointment,
decided not to reinvest their dividends, and had
kept her cheques. Tradespeople, hit by the defalcations
of other customers, had insisted upon being paid,
and as her weekly expenses were never less than two
hundred pounds it had not taken her long to get through
a fortune.</p>

<p>Yet with admirable fortitude and a wonderful discernment
of human nature, she had refused General
von Demidoff's offer, although she was in grave financial
and personal danger. But she knew her man. She
was aware that he would tell the story to all his friends&mdash;and
the general mixed only in the very best society&mdash;and,
better than that, she was willing to stake her
life, as she had done her liberty, that within a few days
he would be back again with twenty thousand pounds
at least, which he would literally thrust into her hands,
and insist upon her keeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
I have given this story in detail because it is typical
of the methods of Germany's greatest war swindler.
It is taken from the account of the preliminary examination
before the judge in Berlin, who at first would scarcely
be brought to believe that the general had actually
returned to Frau Kupfer's flat, and had compelled her
to accept twenty-five thousand pounds for investment
in her food trust.</p>

<p>The money came as a godsend, and once more the
precious pair of swindlers were rejoicing. Of course,
the mother was the brains of the movement. Gertrude
Kupfer had nothing to do except to look pretty and
wear the most costly clothes.</p>

<p>There were very few young men worth attracting
to the flat for her mother to rob, though now and then
she was able to relieve monetary pressure by bringing
along a wounded officer of family and position who
could be tempted to invest a few hundred pounds.
Frau Kupfer, however, thought only in thousands,
even if she was willing to take any money, however
small in amount.</p>

<p>For over eighteen months the merry game continued.
The great war increased in intenseness, and the world
was topsy-turvy, but Frau Kupfer and Gertrude indulged
in every extravagant pleasure, and swindled
high and low alike. Some one had to pay for those
champagne dinners, and for the clothes they wore.
Gertrude Kupfer alone averaged fifty pounds a week
on her wardrobe.</p>

<p>Frau Kupfer gave many lavish entertainments to
wounded soldiers. Once she took the whole seating
capacity of a theatre and filled the building with soldiers,
and while mother and daughter were at the zenith of
success they must have given tea-parties to thousands
of warriors.</p>

<p>The money dribbled through their fingers like water,
and fresh dupes had to be found almost daily to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the interest due to the original investors. The smallest
interest promised had been one hundred per cent per
annum, and for many months the widow managed to
remit the amount owing. It was a wonderful feat
considering the circumstances, but she stopped at
nothing, and she even swindled the maidservants out
of their savings.</p>

<p>One of her brightest ideas was to patronize the small
tradespeople, and thus bring them under her influence.
In due course they succumbed, and sums from ten
to two hundred pounds were obtained from them.</p>

<p>Nothing worried Germany's "Madame Humbert."
Berlin was thronged with wounded; the papers were
beginning to give hints of defeats; and it was admitted
that a complete victory for the Fatherland was out of
the question&mdash;but Frau Kupfer was unperturbed. She
was merry and light-hearted, and she lived so well
that her naturally plump face and stout figure expanded,
and she was a living testimony to the ineffectiveness
of the British blockade. Her circle of friends continued
to grow. Her dinner-parties were all the more
appreciated. She was one of the most sought after
persons in Berlin society, and in the hour of her triumph
she never thought of the dark, underground dungeons
that are so numerous in Germany. It seemed as though
she could never know defeat, no matter what happened
to her country.</p>

<p>Christmas Day, 1916, found Berlin a city of gloom,
save for the gorgeous flat where Frau Kupfer was entertaining
a score of high-born society dames and a few
elderly men to a sumptuous repast. It proved to be
the last of a long series, for she was taken ill after the
dinner, and for the next three weeks was too ill to leave
her room, and in those three weeks the Berlin police
discovered all about the great swindle. An accident
led to the catastrophe.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that Frau Kupfer had two flats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and that she used the smaller one as a storing place for
provisions for her own use. One evening a vigilant-eyed
policeman, who was feeling hungry, noticed that
several large parcels were being delivered at a certain
flat near the Wilhelmstrasse. He had been warned
to keep a look-out for food hoarders, and he came to
the conclusion that this was an attempt to evade the
regulations. He therefore forced his way past the
carters into the flat, and, having ordered the terrified
maid to clear out, examined the place for himself.
It did not take him long to discover enough provisions
to stock a grocer's shop. There were scores of hams,
thousands of preserves neatly stacked against the walls,
boxes of cigars, cigarettes, cases of wine, and plenty
of flour, sugar, sweets, etc. I fancy the policeman
indulged in a good meal before he reported to Police
President von Jagow what he had found.</p>

<p>That night Frau Kupfer and her daughter were arrested
on a charge of contravening the food regulations, and
with their arrest the bubble burst. The "investors,"
first uneasy, grew alarmed, and began to talk. A few
days later they all knew that they had been swindled.</p>

<p>Inside two years Frau Kupfer had robbed them of
two hundred thousand pounds, all of which she had
managed to dissipate, leaving nothing for them. The
Food Trust had had no existence save in her imagination.
Mother and daughter are now in damp cells
in the Moabit Prison, and when Frau Kupfer leaves
that ghastly prison house she will be in her coffin, for
in Germany swindling is considered ten times a greater
offence than murder, however brutal that murder may
have been, and the greatest of Hun food swindlers
will spend the remainder of her life in prison.</p>

<p>Gertrude Kupfer, however, will be released in a few
years because it has been held that she acted entirely
under the influence of her mother, and was in no way
an originator of the swindle.</p>

<span class="subhead">MADAME GUERIN, MATRIMONIAL AGENT</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">There</span> have been many matrimonial agency
swindlers, but when Madame Guerin, the
plump little Frenchwoman with the pleasant
and engaging manner, entered that "profession" she
introduced new methods into that old form of fraud.
She did not hanker after a lot of clients, preferring to
find a nice, gullible man with money, scientifically
relieve him of it, and then pass on to the next. Her
career proved short and exciting, and only by an accident
did it fail to wind up with a tragedy. But that was
not her fault, for she showed that to obtain a fortune
she was capable of running any risk.</p>

<p>It was at Versailles, in the shadow of the old palace,
that Madame Guerin, with the assistance of a friend,
who was known as Cesbron, but who was really her
husband, started her matrimonial agency.</p>

<p>It was no ordinary affair worked from a cheap suite
of offices with all the usual appliances of a modern
business. Madame Guerin could not be as sordid as
that. She was human and sympathetic, and her personality
was electric. She had reached that time of
life when men found her society agreeable, because a
flirtation could not be taken seriously by her. She
let them understand that she knew that most men
wanted young and pretty wives with fortunes, and
that she was in a position to help them to find their
ideal.</p>

<p>Her "business premises" took the shape of a pleasant,
secluded Villa, beautifully furnished and delightfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
managed. It was an honour to be invited to an intimate
little dinner at her home, and her invitations were very
seldom declined. When it was tactfully whispered
that the fair tenant was in the habit of bringing very
eligible girls and handsome bachelors together, she
quickly found the sort of clients she required.</p>

<p>One of her first victims was a man of good family,
who held a remunerative Government post. He was
just the type of man who would rather die than enter
into negotiations with the average matrimonial agent,
but over a recherché meal at the Villa there seemed to
be no loss of dignity in half-carelessly discussing his
desire to marry a girl of beauty and fortune.</p>

<p>It was then that Madame Guerin revealed talents
of a high order as a swindler. She never lost her pose
of the smart society woman who was entertaining a
friend and talking about his future amid the soft lights
and the restful furniture.</p>

<p>When the Government official mentioned that he
had about three hundred a year in addition to his salary
of about the same amount, Madame Guerin decided
that there must be a way of separating him from some
of his fortune by persuading him that she was going
to add to it.</p>

<p>"I know a very pretty girl," she said languidly,
"a dear girl, too, and one who is anxious to marry.
She is an orphan, and is bothered by fortune-hunters.
She would like to become a gentleman's wife, and as she
has five thousand a year derived from first-class securities,
it seems to me, my friend, that she would just
about suit you."</p>

<p>Five thousand a year! It made his mouth water.</p>

<p>"Where can I meet this delightful lady?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"As she is my dearest friend I could invite her here,"
she answered, after a moment's pause. "Her name
is Miss Northcliffe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
"She is English then?" said the official, but there
was no disapproval in his tone.</p>

<p>"Her mother was French," said Madame Guerin,
who had all the time been watching his face. "Her
father was an eminent doctor in London. Miss Northcliffe
loves France, and she has often told me she would
love to be married to a Frenchman and live all her
life in Paris."</p>

<p>The bait took, for the fish rose to it greedily. Thereupon
Madame Guerin, feeling she had "landed" him,
dropped her pose as hostess and became a matrimonial
agent. Of course her expenses would be heavy in
connection with the visit of Miss Northcliffe. She
would have to furnish a suite of rooms specially for the
great English heiress. Then, as he would gain five
thousand pounds a year by the introduction, it would
not be out of place if he paid something in advance.
Madame Guerin guaranteed success, and so forth.
He believed every word.</p>

<p>"You and my dear girl friend will be thrown together
for days," she said, in a confidential tone. "I'll invite
no one else here, and it'll be your own fault if you don't
win her. But you must send me one of your photographs
to-night, and I will show it to her the moment
she arrives. She is a very impressionable, impulsive
girl, and I am certain she will fall in love with your
picture."</p>

<p>Most men will believe a woman's flattery, and in the
case of this French official he swallowed Madame Guerin's
with avidity. It seemed to him he was on the road
to riches, and he scarcely hesitated to send not only
the photograph but a preliminary fee of a hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>If he was disturbed by doubts during the succeeding
days, they were set at rest when an invitation arrived
to meet Miss Northcliffe at dinner at the cosy Villa.
He was, as he admitted afterwards, almost crazy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
delight. The heiress was a reality. Madame Guerin
had not been "pulling his leg" after all. Had she
asked him for a thousand pounds there and then he
would probably have paid it without a murmur.</p>

<p>The dinner was a brilliant success from start to
finish. Never before had he met such a charming,
unaffected girl. A typical English beauty with fair
hair, a peach-like skin and dark grey eyes, who dressed
exquisitely, and spoke French with a fascinating accent.
Her reserve, too, was perfectly enchanting. She did
not gush or chatter, and during the greater part of the
dinner she hardly uttered a word, but towards the end
she became animated.</p>

<p>"She said she would wait until she had made up
her mind about you before becoming friendly," whispered
Madame Guerin at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>He thrilled with pleasure and turned to resume his
conversation with Miss Northcliffe; and when he left
the Villa close on midnight his brain was in a whirl.</p>

<p>Miss Northcliffe had plainly shown her preference
for him, and he was in love with her. He was an expert
on old engravings and modern poetry, and she had,
wonderful to relate, revealed a knowledge of those two
subjects which, though not profound, proved that she
would be an ideal collaborator when they were married.</p>

<p>And then her dress! It was a dream, an exquisite
creation that might have been made out of angels'
wings. The pearl necklace the English heiress had worn
was worth twenty thousand pounds. At least, Madame
Guerin said so, and she ought to know, because she
had some famous pearls herself. He lay awake most
of the night exulting over his good fortune, and early
the following morning rushed off to Versailles to take
Miss Northcliffe for a motor drive.</p>

<p>A week later Madame Guerin suggested that he
should propose, but she warned him that the girl was
suspicious of fortune-hunters and that he must prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to her that he was not a needy vagabond marrying
to be kept.</p>

<p>He laughed at the notion, but he took it seriously
all the same, and when Miss Northcliffe modestly and
blushingly accepted his offer of marriage he impulsively
asked to be tested as to his means.</p>

<p>But Miss Northcliffe preferred to leave that to her
dear friend and guardian, Madame Guerin, and the
latter thereupon suggested that he should realize a
couple of thousand pounds and settle it right away on
Miss Northcliffe, who was, of course, equally willing
to supply evidence that her fortune was not a myth.</p>

<p>The infatuated man declined to doubt his fiancée
for a moment, and the two thousand pounds were in
the possession of Madame Guerin two days later. She
received the money with a congratulatory smile, and
told him to call again the following Sunday and fix the
date for the wedding.</p>

<p>There were four days to Sunday, and how he passed
them he never knew. Certainly he was a very inefficient
public servant during that time, for his mind was
concentrated on the beauty and fortune of the lovely
English girl who was about to become his wife. When
Sunday came round he was up at dawn, and two hours
before he was due to start for Versailles he was hatted
and gloved.</p>

<p>The Villa looked very inviting as he walked up to it
and pulled the old-fashioned bell. A long pause ensued,
and then the fat cook opened the door and breathlessly
informed him that Madame was resting in her room
but would be down in a few minutes. He expressed his
regrets, but when he was in the drawing-room he began
to feel that there was something wrong. The atmosphere
depressed him, and he had to reprove himself
audibly for being morbid to prevent a fit of pessimism
overwhelming him.</p>

<p>He was staring through the window when Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Guerin entered, very pale and dabbing at her eyes with
a handkerchief. In great alarm he rushed to her side.
What had happened? Where was Miss Northcliffe?
Was she ill? A dozen questions tumbled over one
another, and all the time the plump little widow tried
to control her sobs.</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur," she exclaimed, with a piteous
expression, "how shall I break the news? I am distracted,
desolate! Miss Northcliffe&mdash;she has gone&mdash;disappeared.
I know not where. She may be kidnapped
or she may have run away. I am too distracted
to be able to think. It is all dreadful and&mdash;" A flood
of tears completed the sentence.</p>

<p>In vain he implored her to tell him plainly what had
happened. The result was that he left the Villa aware
that he had lost his two thousand pounds and dimly
suspicious of Madame Guerin, although she had sworn
that Miss Northcliffe had taken away every penny of
it, and, indeed, owed a goodly sum to her.</p>

<p>Further reflection convinced him that he had been
swindled, and he began to think of appealing to the
police, but at forty-five one does not do things in a
hurry, and he was not the person to court ridicule.
He had walked into the trap open-eyed, and if his colleagues
in the Government service heard the story of
the "English heiress" they would make his life a misery
with their vulgar chaff. So beyond another visit to
the Versailles Villa to inquire if Miss Northcliffe had
returned he took no steps to recover his losses.</p>

<p>The next exploit was even more subtle. Some one
introduced a well-to-do Parisian of the name of Lalère
to Madame Guerin along with the information that
he was on the look-out for a wealthy wife. As Monsieur
Lalère had a comfortable bank balance of his own she
enthusiastically agreed to provide him with a bride,
and when she learnt that he was partial to an English
girl her delight was boundless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
On this occasion the Versailles Villa was not utilized
as the stage for the little comedy. She decided to vary
her methods, and she started by going to London and
putting up at a fashionable hotel. The two thousand
pounds extracted from the Government official came
in very handy, as even in London one can live quite a
long time in an expensive hotel on that amount.</p>

<p>Shortly after her arrival Lalère came at her invitation.
Madame Guerin was, of course, fashionably
dressed and apparently busy all day calling upon the
leading members of the English aristocracy. She could
not give him more than a few minutes one afternoon,
and when he expressed disappointment she promised
to do her best when she had fulfilled her social obligations.
She mentioned glibly that she was dining that night
with Mrs. Asquith, whose husband was then Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and that the day after she was lunching
with "the Crewes."</p>

<p>The Frenchman was greatly impressed by these lies,
and he therefore appreciated all the more her spontaneous
invitation to him to accompany her to the opera the
following Monday evening. It seemed that a friend
of hers had been called out of town and that her stall
was vacant. Madame Guerin added that she hoped to
be able to introduce Lalère to some English heiresses
between the acts.</p>

<p>Monday night found Madame Guerin and Monsieur
Lalère seated in the stalls at the Covent Garden Theatre.
Just before the curtain went up the woman indicated
a private box wherein three young ladies, beautifully
dressed, were sitting.</p>

<p>"Three friends of mine and all rich, monsieur," she
said confidentially. "You can have your choice. Let
me know the one you prefer. They will be guided
entirely by my advice."</p>

<p>Of course after that Lalère had no eyes for the stage,
and some of the greatest singers in the world failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to engage his attention. His eyes were always wandering
to the box where the three English beauties were,
and he studied their appearances carefully. Eventually
his choice alighted upon the girl in the centre, whose
name was, Madame Guerin informed him, Miss Northcliffe.</p>

<p>Thus once more the mysterious Miss Northcliffe
appeared on the scene, and again she found a Frenchman
who was mesmerized by her beauty and her reputed
fortune. All the acting that night at Covent Garden
was not behind the footlights. Both Madame Guerin
and Miss Northcliffe could have given points to many
of the professionals.</p>

<p>That the girl who acted as the matrimonial agent's
decoy was clever and educated there can be no doubt.
She could speak French fluently, and she had a first-rate
knowledge of the world. She had been able to
talk intelligently to the authority on old engravings
and modern poetry, and now she charmed Lalère by
her acquaintance with the subjects that interested him.</p>

<p>The sequel was that Lalère paid Madame Guerin
fifteen hundred pounds on the understanding that she
was to bring about a match between himself and Miss
Northcliffe. But no sooner had he parted with the
money than the "heiress" vanished, greatly to Madame
Guerin's distress and Lalère's annoyance; and all he
had to show for his expenditure was a cynical and bitter
contempt for women-folk in general.</p>

<p>Success made Madame Guerin avaricious. She began
to crave for a large fortune, and she believed that she
was clever enough to gain it at one stroke. Experience
had proved that it was easy enough to open a man's
purse with a story of a rich bride, and her victims took
their disappointment so calmly that there was no danger
of retribution. Perhaps the sight of wealthy London
fired her imagination. Anyhow, she immediately began
to look round for a suitable dupe there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
It was, however, necessary to have her husband's
help. As she pretended to be a widow, she called him
her friend, and it was as Monsieur Cesbron that she
introduced him to her friends and acquaintances. Hitherto
Cesbron had wisely kept in the background, an
admiring spectator from afar of his wife's astuteness,
and no doubt he shared in the little windfalls from the
Government official and Lalère.</p>

<p>He was not averse to taking a leading part in the
next big swindle, and it was Cesbron who found the
very man for their purpose. Through a friend he had
heard that in the West End of London there was a doctor
who had saved a considerable sum of money, and who
was in every way a very eligible bachelor.</p>

<p>The initial difficulty was how to make themselves
known to him, but Madame Guerin solved the problem
by planning a pretty little scheme. She might have
called on the doctor in the guise of a patient, but she
decided not to do this lest he discovered there was nothing
the matter with her.</p>

<p>Her final plan was to pretend that she had invented
a new method of sterilizing milk, and that she wished
to have a doctor's opinion of its merits.</p>

<p>Madame Guerin underrated her abilities, for, as events
proved, she need not have bothered about the "invention."
The doctor was pleased to make the
acquaintance of the charming widow, and she soon had
every opportunity for dragging in references to her
rich young lady friends who were anxious to find
husbands.</p>

<p>The medical man was incredulous at first, then curious,
and eventually impressed. Madame Guerin did not
look like a swindler or talk in the manner of a professional
matrimonial agent. She was too human for that, and
there was nothing of the hard-headed business woman
about her.</p>

<p>The doctor readily agreed to join her at a dinner-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>party
and meet the young heiresses, and choose which
of them he would care to marry.</p>

<p>The meeting took place at an hotel, and on this occasion
Miss Northcliffe failed to win his approval. A young
lady whose name was given as Miss Smith gained his vote.</p>

<p>Miss Smith was a beauty, vivacious, clever, and
fascinating. When he was persuaded to believe that
she had a large fortune, the doctor considered himself
the luckiest man in the world.</p>

<p>The girl, one of Madame Guerin's cutest confederates,
was equally as good an actress as Miss Northcliffe,
and, shrewd man of the world as the doctor was, she
had no difficulty in persuading him that he had captured
her maiden fancy.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said, the doctor was not a penniless
adventurer. He was a prosperous professional man,
with a good position and a consoling balance at his
bankers, the <i>Crédit Lyonnais</i>. Apart from the somewhat
unconventional means by which they had become
acquainted, the engagement was, on the surface, nothing
remarkable. Miss Smith was obviously well educated,
and fit to preside over the doctor's home. They were,
therefore, of equal social position.</p>

<p>Madame Guerin was, of course, the brains of the
affair, and only the "spade work" was left to her
husband. It was she who decided when she and Miss
Smith should leave London on the plea that they had
to keep engagements in France, and it was she who
instructed Miss Smith to agree to her fiancé's request
that she should name the day.</p>

<p>The two women left for Paris the day before Cesbron,
but they only stopped a day at the capital before they
proceeded to the Villa the swindler had rented in the
vicinity of Fontainebleau. It was situated in a very
lonely spot, and Madame Guerin and Cesbron had taken
it because they had decided to murder the doctor and
obtain his fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
They had already endeavoured to get the doctor to
transfer his account to the Paris bank which they said
looked after Miss Smith's immense fortune; but he
declined to effect the change. However, they were
not disheartened. If they were equal to killing the
doctor they were also capable of forging a claim to his
money at the <i>Crédit Lyonnais</i>.</p>

<p>The marriage was fixed to take place in the second
week in November, 1906, and early in the same month
Madame Guerin invited the doctor to spend a few days
at her Villa before he became the husband of the heiress.
He was very busy just then, but, of course, he was most
anxious to see his friends, and he accepted the invitation,
and in due course arrived at the isolated house.</p>

<p>If he had not been absorbed in his forthcoming marriage,
the doctor would hardly have found the place
attractive at that time of the year. Of course, Madame
Guerin was always interesting, and she was a perfect
hostess. There were good points about her friend
Cesbron, too, and, with the excitement of the engagement,
the flattery of his hostess, and the attentions of
Cesbron, the doctor was never dull.</p>

<p>He could never be expected to believe that the woman
with the plump, smiling face and the sympathetic eyes had
planned his murder, or that Cesbron, her husband, was
merely waiting for the proper moment to "remove" him.</p>

<p>One afternoon Madame Guerin and the doctor were
chatting in the front room, when Cesbron drove up
in a cart with a huge, iron-bound trunk.</p>

<p>"Is our friend going to be married too?" he asked
jocularly.</p>

<p>Madame Guerin's eyes glinted, but her lips parted
in a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is always buying clothes," she said indifferently,
"and he likes to keep them clean and dry
when travelling. He told me yesterday he had ordered
a new trunk. It is a hobby of his."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
The truth was that that trunk had been purchased
to hold the doctor's corpse!</p>

<p>There was quite a little party at the Villa that night,
and all the time the huge box was waiting in the next
room for its victim. The visitor had no suspicion that
anything was wrong. He knew by now that Madame
Guerin would expect a commission for having introduced
him to the great heiress, but he thought none
the less of her for that. Cesbron, too, was respectful
and attentive, and all appeared to be looking forward
with intense satisfaction to the marriage celebration.
Miss Smith was not, of course, at the Villa. She was
now in Paris selecting her trousseau, and her fiancé
had to be content with a charming little love-letter
which came to him every morning.</p>

<p>The day before the one fixed for the tragedy Cesbron
and the doctor happened to be in the little garden,
when the former playfully started a discussion as to
their respective physical conditions, and before long
the two men had agreed to a friendly wrestling match
to see which of them was the stronger.</p>

<p>To Cesbron's surprise and annoyance, he discovered
that the doctor was by far the better of the two. This
put him out, for it meant that he would have to resort
to fire-arms to achieve his object&mdash;the murder of the
guest.</p>

<p>Cesbron did not like using a revolver. It made a
lot of noise, and, lonely as the Villa was, there was
always the danger that some one might be passing at
the moment of the crime. However, the risk had to
be taken. He knew now for certain that he was quite
incapable of seizing the doctor by the throat and strangling
him, and that if it came to a fight he would be no
match for his opponent.</p>

<p>On November 9, 1906, the doctor was alone writing
a letter in the drawing-room. The house was very
quiet, and he was under the impression that Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Guerin and Cesbron had gone out. At this time of
the year it was dark at half-past four, and the doctor
wrote leisurely, pausing occasionally to improve a
phrase before committing it to writing.</p>

<p>Suddenly an explosion seemed to take place in the
room, and simultaneously he felt something sting him.
The next moment he knew that a bullet had passed
into his neck behind his left ear, cutting through the
tongue and soft palate, and breaking several teeth.</p>

<p>But the wound was not sufficient to prevent his
rising and confronting Cesbron, who was standing near
the door with a smoking revolver in his hand. Only
for a fraction of a second did the two men pause. Then
the injured man made a dash at Cesbron, who, recalling
his playful encounter of the day before, took to flight,
well aware that he would be helpless if the doctor got
his fingers round his throat.</p>

<p>When Cesbron sped into the darkness the doctor
made his way out of the house and into the garden,
stumbling towards the gate. To his surprise this was
locked. Evidently the conspirators had not forgotten
anything.</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do now but to try and
climb over the wall, and he succeeded in getting his
head above the top, but immediately it was silhouetted
against the sky another shot was fired, and for the
second time he was hit. He fell back into the garden,
where, thanks to the darkness and the shelter of the
bushes, he was able to remain concealed until the morning,
when he crawled to the police station at Fontainebleau,
and told the story of the attack on him at the
Villa.</p>

<p>The police took the doctor to the local hospital, and
then went in search of Madame Guerin who, when
arrested, thought to avenge herself by swearing that
the doctor was her accomplice. She lied so skilfully
that she persuaded the police to detain him for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
but in the long run the truth was discovered, and it
was proved that the doctor was merely another of
her dupes.</p>

<p>A strange feature of the case was the disappearance
of Cesbron. The police and detective force of France
searched for him everywhere, but he was never seen,
and the same lack of success was experienced when the
authorities became anxious to make the acquaintance
of the English heiresses, Miss Smith and Miss Northcliffe.
Not a trace of them could be found, and this
was very fortunate for Madame Guerin, because, when
she was brought up for trial in July, 1907, she could
pose as a poor woman who was being prosecuted whilst
her partners were allowed to go free owing to the incompetence
of the authorities.</p>

<p>The jury took a lenient view of her swindles, ignoring
the charge of attempted murder, because it was undoubtedly
Cesbron who had fired the two shots at the
doctor, and without his presence in the dock it was
impossible to tell exactly what part the female prisoner
took in the final tragedy. But that she was a very
dangerous adventuress and swindler was obvious, and
everybody was surprised when the judge passed sentence
of three years' imprisonment only.</p>

<p>Her face lit up with joy. She had been afraid that
it would have been at least ten years. Three years!
Why, it was worth running such a bogus matrimonial
agency if that was the only punishment.</p>

<p>It is the French custom to sentence any accused
person who fails to answer the charge in person, and
Cesbron was ordered two years' hard labour. He did
not, however, oblige the prosecution by appearing
and undergoing his punishment, and from that day to
this nothing has been seen or heard of him.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MURDER OF MADAME HOUET</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">The</span> annals of French crime are rich in dramatic
and extraordinary episodes, but none can
excel in breathless interest the story of the
murder of Madame Houet and the discovery and punishment
of her murderers twelve years after her tragic
death.</p>

<p>Madame Houet was a widow with a fortune estimated
to exceed two hundred and fifty thousand francs, who
lived with her son in a little house in the Rue St. Jacques,
Paris. Her only daughter was married to a wine merchant
named Robert, who was reputed to be well off.
The old lady's son was a big, powerful fellow, whose
weak brain prevented him earning more than a precarious
livelihood, a fact which annoyed his penurious
parent. She scraped and saved and half-starved herself
to be able to add a few coins daily to her store.
In the circumstances, it is not astonishing that amongst
her neighbours she should have had the reputation of
being worth a great deal more than she actually was.</p>

<p>The gossips never tired of discussing her hidden
wealth, and everybody was prepared to hear of her
murder for the sake of her hoard. Even her son-in-law
was ignorant of the extent of her savings&mdash;the old lady
would never discuss the subject with him or anyone
else&mdash;and, after making allowances for the exaggerations
of the neighbours, he came to the conclusion that
his wife's share of her inheritance would not be less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
than a quarter of a million francs. There were times,
too, when he comforted himself with the assurance that
his wife's brother would not live very long. More than
one doctor had hinted that the weak brain would soon
affect the body, and that he would suddenly collapse
and die.</p>

<p>These thoughts induced the wine merchant to sell
his business and retire. Robert had always wanted
to live the life of a gentleman, as he termed it. He
was fond of the theatre and the restaurants, and he
had a mania for tempting fortune on the racecourse
and on the roulette table. So when he observed signs
of decline in his mother-in-law&mdash;and his wife often
wept as she told him that the old lady was fading away&mdash;he
found a purchaser for his shop, pocketed the proceeds,
and went the pace, confident that before he had
spent his capital he would be in possession of Madame
Houet's cash.</p>

<p>But Madame Houet was tougher than he thought,
and easily outlasted the twenty-five thousand francs
Robert had received for his shop. For a few months
Monsieur and Madame Robert were seen everywhere,
and they became familiar figures in the fashionable
restaurants and theatres. When he came to his last
thousand-franc note Robert determined to risk it all
on a visit to a gambling den. He carried out his intention,
and returned home at three in the morning
penniless.</p>

<p>He was now not only without resources, but heavily
in debt. As the husband of Madame Houet's heiress
he had been given extended credit, but the ex-wine
merchant knew that if he failed to keep his agreements
his creditors would complain to his mother-in-law.</p>

<p>But could he hold his creditors back until the old
lady died? Several times a week he called on her and
noticed with increasing alarm that she was daily improving
in health. Her appetite was prodigious, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
he discovered every time he took her out to lunch.
Driven desperate, the penniless man tried forgery,
and by imitating his mother-in-law's signature on the
back of a bill induced the merchant who had purchased
his business to advance him twelve thousand five hundred
francs for three months.</p>

<p>The weeks passed all too swiftly, and when only a
fortnight remained of the three months the forger's
position was worse than ever. Fourteen days more
and the forged bill would be presented and dishonoured,
and Madame Houet would repudiate the signature.
Robert went for long walks every night to think over
the situation, and eventually he found a solution.</p>

<p>"I have urgent business to attend to," he told his
wife one morning, "and I am afraid I shall have to be
often away from your side. Why not pay that long-promised
visit to your aunt in Marseilles? I should be
happier if I knew you were with her."</p>

<p>His wife agreed, and for a month was out of Paris,
and during that month the tragedy occurred.</p>

<p>Robert had decided to murder his mother-in-law
so that his wife might receive at once her share of the
estate. He knew that the old lady had recently made
her will bequeathing her fortune in equal shares to her
son and her daughter, and, therefore, there was no
danger of Julia losing her inheritance. The ex-wine
merchant, however, was not capable of carrying out
the plan unaided, and he sought an acquaintance,
Bastien, a jobbing carpenter, who promised to help
in the murder for a fee of twenty thousand francs,
to be paid within thirty days of Madame Robert's
receipt of her legacy. The terms were agreed to, and
they began to make their plans.</p>

<p>There was a big garden attached to a house in the
Rue Vaugirard, and Robert rented both for a month,
and the night before the murder he and Bastien dug
a grave for their intended victim, who at the time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
were working was busy counting her savings with a
view to sending the money to the bank in the morning.
The widow may have been a miser, but she had a great
deal of common sense, and she never kept large sums
in her home.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, she and her son had of late begun
to quarrel fiercely. She had accused him of being lazy,
and he had flung reproaches at her, and it was known
in the Rue St. Jacques that the Houets were constantly
at loggerheads.</p>

<p>"There'll be a tragedy in that house," said the landlord
of the inn at the corner. "The police ought to
be told. It is not safe to leave the old woman alone
with that crazy son of hers."</p>

<p>When the ill-feeling between the mother and son was
at its height, Bastien, Robert's confederate, drove up
to her residence in a cab, and on being admitted to her
presence announced that he came with an invitation
to spend the day with her son-in-law. Madame eagerly
accepted, for the three meals at his expense would enable
her to add at least a franc to her store.</p>

<p>On the journey to the Rue Vaugirard the widow
commented on the fact that her strange companion
held a coil of rope in his hands.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with an impudent grin, "I bought
it for a special job. I hope it will prove strong
enough."</p>

<p>Again he grinned meaningly; but the old woman
was, of course, unconscious of the fact that the "special
job" he referred to was her murder by strangulation.</p>

<p>The cab stopped outside the gate at the end of the
garden and some distance from the house. With remarkable
agility Madame Houet descended, and when
Bastien had opened the entrance to the garden passed
in. She had not proceeded a dozen paces, however,
nor had she had time to notice the newly-made grave,
when two strong hands shot out and gripped her by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the throat, and before she could utter a sound Bastien's
rope was around her neck, and she was swiftly strangled.
The next ten minutes was spent by the men filling in
the grave, and when that task was over they adjourned
to the house and steadied their nerves by imbibing
copious draughts of wine.</p>

<p>"The fortune is mine!" Robert cried exultingly.
"Bastien, my friend, we have nothing to fear. You
have only to keep your mouth shut, and the police are
helpless, and ten years hence, even if they discover
proofs of our guilt, they won't be able to touch us.
That is the law of France. A murderer must be convicted
within ten years of the last arrest for the crime
or else he goes free without any penalty."</p>

<p>"And the money?" asked Bastien sharply.</p>

<p>"I have been told that it takes about a month to
wind up the affairs of a dead woman," said the ex-wine
merchant. "My wife will have her mother's
fortune by then. Call four weeks from to-day and I
will hand you your well-earned reward."</p>

<p>They shook hands on it and parted. Nothing remained
except to wait, and that was easy enough.</p>

<p>The instant Madame Houet was missed her son was
arrested. On the face of it there seemed to be every
justification for that procedure, and the detectives
felt that they had the murderer in their power. That
the widow had been murdered they had no doubt,
and it was only when they were searching for her body
that they arrested Robert and Bastien. Following
the capture of the latter the son was released, it being
admitted that he could have had nothing to do with
the disappearance of his mother. It was, however,
quite another matter to find the corpse. Madame
Houet had simply vanished, and, although the detectives
built up a strong case against the two accused, they
were compelled to release them because they were
unable to produce the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
It was proved that Bastien had called for the widow
and had driven away with her, and it was known that
he had fetched her at the instigation of Robert. The
two men agreed that they had seen Madame Houet
on the day of her disappearance, but swore that she
had left them with the intention of going home. The
cleverest members of the detective force traced the
men's movements on the fatal day, but failed to discover
the garden in the Rue Vaugirard, for Robert had,
of course, never gone near it since the hasty burial,
and, apparently, there was no one to give information
to the police about the strange man who had paid the
rent for it for a month and had not occupied it for more
than a day and that day September 13th, 1821.</p>

<p>When Robert and his confederate walked out of their
cells they entered a café and had lunch, and they confined
their conversation to denunciations of the authorities
for having kept them in gaol so long. Before
they separated, however, Robert fixed an appointment
with his fellow-assassin to call for the twenty thousand
francs and they went their way, animated by feelings
of triumph, the ex-wine merchant, especially, scarcely
able to suppress his joy.</p>

<p>There is a well-known proverb which says that "A
little learning is a dangerous thing," and Robert, the
murderer, discovered its truth when he sent his wife
to claim half her mother's fortune. He had carefully
studied the laws relating to murder, and, confident
that the police would never find Madame Houet's
body, he had willingly accepted the inconveniences
of being constantly under suspicion because he
believed that the ten years required by the law would
soon pass and place him beyond danger. After the
tenth year if the corpse and his guilt were brought to
light he would not be prosecuted. It was a curious
regulation, but it just suited Robert, and he hummed
gaily to himself while awaiting his wife's return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
She came back with a long face and whispered the
bad news.</p>

<p>"The gentlemen in the Government office told me,"
she said, between her tears of disappointment, "that
under the law they cannot distribute my mother's
money until ten years have passed, when, if her body
isn't found, she becomes legally dead. At present,
according to the law, she is considered to be alive, and,
therefore, her estate cannot be touched."</p>

<p>The ex-wine merchant nearly collapsed, and it was
some time before he induced his wife to complain that
she was practically destitute and extract an allowance
of thirty francs a week on account from the State.
For that she had to sign a bond guaranteeing to repay
the money to her mother if the latter should appear on
the scene again.</p>

<p>By dint of desperate appeals to relatives Robert
succeeded in getting the money to take up the forged
bill, but he had now another danger to face&mdash;Bastien,
the jobbing carpenter, who, he knew, would make a
terrible row when told of the failure to get hold of the
widow's money.</p>

<p>The carpenter came with an expectant expression,
and left infuriated. Vainly had Robert explained.
Bastien bluntly informed him that he did not believe
a word.</p>

<p>"You are trying to defraud me!" he had shrieked,
shaking his fist and sending Madame Robert into hysterics.
"I will be even with you yet, and if to-morrow
you have not the money ready, I&mdash;" He ceased
abruptly and shuffled out of the house.</p>

<p>He did not come back for a fortnight. Then ensued
a repetition of the first scene, terminated by Robert
handing him two hundred and fifty francs.</p>

<p>It was a couple of months before Bastien believed
his explanation of his poverty, but the two murderers
continued to quarrel whenever they met. Robert was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
again hopelessly in debt, and could hardly raise a few
francs to give to his fellow-assassin, who was blackmailing
him daily. Eventually things became so bad
that Bastien in desperation committed a burglary for
which he was arrested and sent to penal servitude for
seven years.</p>

<p>Then fresh information reached the authorities and
Robert was arrested again, whilst Bastien was brought
from prison and taken with the ex-wine merchant
before the magistrate. They were severely examined,
but despite many contradictions and lies they had to
be discharged again, Bastien returning to gaol, and
Robert to the miserable rooms he called his home.
This second arrest, however, meant that still ten years
would have to elapse before Madame Houet was considered
dead in law and her assassins free from
punishment.</p>

<p>When Bastien had served his sentence for burglary
he began to blackmail Robert systematically, until
another robbery landed him in gaol again. As the years
went by he grew jealous of the liberty enjoyed by Robert,
and, becoming garrulous, eventually confided in an old
convict with whom he worked exactly nine years and
eight months from the day of his second arrest. His
fellow-prisoner had twelve years to serve, and was,
accordingly, not to be feared, but the very week he
heard Bastien's story of the tragedy in the Rue Vaugirard
he saved a warder's life by an act of bravery,
and was rewarded by a free pardon in March, 1833.</p>

<p>The pardon, however, did not include employment,
and the ex-convict found the world hard and unsympathetic.
No one would have anything to do with a
man whose record included a murder and several violent
assaults, and he was starving when it occurred to him
that he might be able to make something out of Bastien's
confession. He, thereupon, called on the chief of
police, and offered to tell him where the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
widow was provided he was given five hundred francs
when his statement had been tested.</p>

<p>The chief willingly promised the sum mentioned,
for it was a continual source of exasperation to him
that two such villains as Robert and Bastien should
have outwitted him and his legion of trained detectives.</p>

<p>The ex-convict recounted what Bastien had told him,
and for the third time Robert and Bastien were charged
together. They were not so confident now, for something
seemed to tell them that they were not going to
escape again.</p>

<p>It is the French custom to have the accused present
at any important discovery bearing upon their case,
and Robert and Bastien were, accordingly, handcuffed
and taken to the garden at the back of the house in the
Rue Vaugirard. Half a dozen detectives were provided
with spades, and, whilst the prisoners looked on,
they dug as if for their lives. But they met with no
reward, and Robert, who had remained motionless
throughout, was regarding them with a sneering smile
when one of the detectives suddenly turned on him.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way, man!" he cried contemptuously.
"One would think that the widow Houet had
gripped you by the feet."</p>

<p>On hearing this Robert started as though he had
been shot, and it did not surprise the officials in the
least when the skeleton of the murdered woman was
found exactly under the spot where he had been standing.
It was plain that he had hoped to keep the officers
away from it and that his ruse would cause them to
leave the garden without the corpse. Had they done
so, he and Bastien would have had to be released.</p>

<p>The skeleton was in an almost perfect state of preservation
and there was not the slightest difficulty in
identifying it, for the rope was still around the neck and
on one of the fingers of the left hand was a gold ring.</p>

<p>The ex-wine merchant and his confederate were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
tried before the Paris Criminal Court and found guilty
of murder. For some extraordinary reason, however,
the jury added "extenuating circumstances" to their
verdict and this took away from the judge the power
to inflict death. They were, however, consigned to a
living death in one of the French convict settlements,
and there they existed for a few miserable years before
dying of inanition, overwork, and monotony.</p>

<p>Practically the whole of Madame Houet's fortune
was inherited by her son, who died in an asylum, and
eventually the money which had been the motive for
a terrible crime passed into the coffers of the state,
the widow's son leaving no heirs.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BOOTMAKER'S ROYAL WOOING</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the Essen doctor advised Maria
Hussmann, Frederick Krupp's "lady housekeeper,"
to try a course of thermal baths
at Aix-la-Chapelle she was only too glad to do so. Maria
was a typical German woman, heavy, solid, and, as
she was in the late thirties, fond of boasting of her
respectability. She styled herself "a noble lady,"
and she was in the habit of explaining to her acquaintances
that she only "condescended" to manage Herr
Krupp's domestic staff for him, having been tempted
by an enormous salary, the latter being a tribute to
her excellence and her social position. She always
carried herself with great dignity, and Krupp, who
had a comic admiration for what in Germany passes
for good breeding, was rather proud of his employée's
pride.</p>

<p>Of course, he readily granted her permission to make
the journey to the favourite resort, and to stay there
for at least a month. Maria, therefore, packed up her
trunks, and started for Aix-la-Chapelle. The woman
had a fairly large sum of money saved, and, anxious
to meet the best people, she put up at a first-class hotel,
and placed herself under the care of a physician with
a European reputation. In this way she acquired
position at once in the hotel, and while carefully
suppressing the fact that she was the Cannon King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
housekeeper she let it be known that she derived her
means from him.</p>

<p>Everybody thereupon assumed that she was a relation
of Krupp's, and after that expressed no surprise that she
should be so rich.</p>

<p>The tall woman with the red face, who looked so
grotesque in her fashionable clothes, was most assiduous
in following her doctor's orders, and she was soon a
well-known figure amongst the patients, who came
from all parts of the world. When the scores of impecunious
German officers heard that she was actually
related to the millionaire Krupp they crowded round
her, and the widow took their admiration as due entirely
to her personal charm! Every day she had more
invitations to lunch than she could accept, and there
was keen competition for the honour of escorting her
to the theatre or opera. This was, indeed, life, and,
large as was Frederick Krupp's monthly cheque, she
began to look forward to the time when she would be
independent of it, and would have an officer husband&mdash;the
ambition of every German woman&mdash;and a home
of her own to manage.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she met, purely by accident, a man
who raised her ambitions even higher. Hitherto she
had considered it bliss to hear a young officer of the
Prussian Guards whisper insincerities into her ear,
but once she became acquainted with a future King
she forgot all other men.</p>

<p>It was a very hot afternoon in mid-August, 1897, when
Maria, walking slowly between an avenue of trees,
slipped on a piece of orange-peel, and she would have
met with a serious accident had not a gentleman caught
her in time. The shock, however, gravely affected
her, and her rescuer had to escort her to a friendly seat
to give her time to recover. There he waited politely
until she signified that she was better, and it was only
then that she took notice of him. She saw a man above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
medium height with a saturnine countenance, dark
eyes and a black moustache. She noticed that the
expression of his mouth hovered between a sneer and
a scowl, and somehow his grey suit and light Homburg
hat failed to give a touch of relief to an exterior not
at all pleasing. However, Maria was too great a "perfect
lady" not to feel grateful for the service he had
rendered her, and she thanked him, ending up by revealing
her identity.</p>

<p>"I am charmed, madame," said the stranger, speaking
in French. "My name is&mdash;but, no, I must respect
my incognito. I am Count d'Este. You can know
me by that." A profound bow followed, and the next
moment the count had disappeared.</p>

<p>Marie went back to her hotel with the words "incognito"
and "count" ringing in her ears. She was sure
that the stranger had been impressed by her, and she
was equally certain that he was a great man, for only
monarchs and their heirs talked of travelling "incognito."
He was undoubtedly something better than
a count, although Maria had an exaggerated veneration
for any title of nobility.</p>

<p>Of course, the "lady housekeeper from Essen"
procured an <i>Almanach de Gotha</i> at the hotel, but as
it was not illustrated, she could not identify the mysterious
gentleman, and she might have given up the task
had she not met him again at the same place the following
day. On this occasion he came straight up to her,
and in the most charming and natural manner entered
into conversation, carefully inquiring first if she had
suffered any ill-consequences from the previous day's
mishap, and expressing the greatest delight when she
declared that she was quite well again.</p>

<p>They parted after half an hour, the count in a sad
voice informing her that owing to fear of being recognized
and his incognito not being respected he could not ask
her to be his guest at a restaurant. The remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
fired her curiosity, and she went at once to the public
library, and within a quarter of an hour was surrounded
by a score of books on the royal families of Europe.
It took her, however, nearly two hours to solve the
mystery, and it was a bound volume of the Paris <i>Figaro</i>
that gave her the clue she was seeking.</p>

<p>"He's the Archduke Francis Ferdinand," she whispered
to herself, and her body vibrated. "The heir
to the throne! And we're such good friends! Now I'll
have no difficulty in being received into the society
that I've always longed to enter."</p>

<p>When she reached her hotel there was a retired German
colonel waiting to take her for a promenade, and at
any other time Maria would have given half her fortune
to be seen in his company, but now she almost condescendingly
begged him to excuse her, and as she lumbered
up the stairs the colonel could only stand in the hall,
stare after her, and mutter curses expressive of his
surprise and anger. He had planned to marry the
wealthy relative of Frederick Krupp, and so save himself
from bankruptcy. But Frau Hussmann had no
use for common colonels now. She could think only
of her august friend, the heir to the throne of Austria;
no one else mattered.</p>

<p>It was her intention to keep her discovery to herself,
but when on the third day she found the "count"
obviously waiting for her she could not restrain herself
when after five minutes' promenading together she
had yet to hear a word from him. The "count"
was in one of his melancholy moods, but since seeing
him last she had read in several papers how addicted
he was to pessimism, and she had already come to the
conclusion that her mission in life was to save him from
melancholia, and give him a new interest in life.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial and Royal Highness"&mdash;she began.</p>

<p>But he started convulsively, and laid a warning
hand on her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
"Ah, I see you have discovered my secret," he said
with a most anxious expression. "Trust a woman's
wit to get to the truth. You pierced my incognito,
madame. But I am not angry. It is proof that you
take an interest in an unhappy man. I thank you
for it."</p>

<p>"Unhappy?" she echoed in amazement. "Your
Royal Highness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Franz&mdash;to my friends," he said, looking
at her steadily, "and we are friends, are we not?"</p>

<p>Maria could scarcely speak, so excited was she by
the honour. The Archduke Francis Ferdinand was
so natural and such a delightful companion! That
very day he told her how his uncle, the Emperor, was
trying to force him to marry an archduchess he did not
love, and he recounted scenes in the Hofburg at Vienna
which simply enthralled Krupp's lady housekeeper,
who felt that she was, indeed, taking a peep into the
most exclusive Court in Europe.</p>

<p>"I can go nowhere without being pestered," said
the melancholy archduke. "I have no real friends.
The Czar and the Kaiser only invite me to their palaces
to introduce me to princesses. I am considered merely
a pawn on the chessboard of Europe, and they never
seem to think that I have a heart like other men, and
that I long for a sweet, sympathetic wife."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and looked into her eyes, and
Maria Hussmann had difficulty in keeping on her feet,
so overcome was she by emotion as she walked in that
shady avenue and knew that she was being made love
to by the future Emperor of Austria and King of
Hungary.</p>

<p>"You understand now why I am in Aix-la-Chapelle,"
he resumed after a pause. "I can experience a little
liberty here, and by paying cash for everything I have
no need to reveal my identity. Of course I dare not
draw cheques on my bankers, for that would give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
away completely. Oh, madame, I am thankful that
I came here, for I have never been so happy since I
met you."</p>

<p>The courtship was not a long one: indeed, it was
much too short for the romantic woman. Nearly
every afternoon she met the archduke, and he always
had some fresh story to tell her of the Hofburg&mdash;the
Kaiser's secret visits there, the drawing up of important
treaties at midnight, the "removing" of political
enemies, and the real meaning of various public actions
of the emperor's. Incidentally he enlightened Marie
as to the real character of Frederick Krupp. He was,
of course, very sorry to have to draw the line at the
millionaire, he said, even if Madame was a relative
of the Cannon King's; but Marie hastened to dissociate
herself from her "relation," explaining that she had a
fortune independent of him, and that if ever she married
she would not want to see too much of the Kaiser's
friend.</p>

<p>A fortnight after the accident the archduke formally
asked Marie to be his wife. She had been expecting
the proposal for days, but she was surprised almost into
hysterics when he actually made the offer. It seemed
too good to be true. Aix-la-Chapelle was then crowded
with beauties of all sorts and conditions. Some of
the loveliest heiresses in Europe were to be seen daily
in the town. The archduke had only to reveal himself
to be flattered and courted by them, and yet he
had chosen her! It was undoubtedly the greatest
compliment she could possibly receive.</p>

<p>In the faintest of tones she said "Yes," and the archduke
bowed over her hand, and impressed a respectful
kiss upon it. "Just like one would expect from a
prince," said the lady housekeeper later when describing
that moment of blissful triumph.</p>

<p>"Of course, we'll be married at once," said Franz
Ferdinand, who was the most attentive and enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of lovers. "Until you are my wife I shall not
know a moment's peace, for if the Emperor got to know
of my matrimonial plans he would have you kidnapped,
Maria, and I should be left to mourn your loss."</p>

<p>The idea of the Emperor abducting this sixteen stone
of solid German flesh would have struck anyone but
Maria as comic. She, however, was too great an admirer
of herself and too romantic to see anything absurd
in the idea.</p>

<p>"I am ready for you at any time, Franz," she said
in a flutter. "You know I am yours for ever now."</p>

<p>How delightful it was to meet the archduke every
day after dusk and discuss the question of immediate
marriage! They made plans, only to unmake them at
their next meeting. Once for a period of three days
Krupp's housekeeper had to live without seeing her
fiancé, but, as he explained on his return to Aix-la-Chapelle,
he had been unexpectedly recalled to Vienna
to take part in a Council of State at the Hofburg.</p>

<p>"Again the Emperor talked of my marrying one
of my cousins," he said with a scowl. "He little
realizes that I am about to wed the girl of my heart,
and one whom I mean to make my Empress when the
right time comes."</p>

<p>Once more they fell to discussing the best place to
get married in. Various Continental cities were mentioned,
but rejected, and eventually the archduke's
suggestion that they should travel to London at once,
go through the marriage ceremony at a register office,
and then in the presence of a priest, and afterwards
return to Aix-la-Chapelle, was adopted. From there
Francis Ferdinand was to inform his uncle as to what
had happened, and prepare for his entry into Austria
with his bride by his side.</p>

<p>"Once you are mine, even the Emperor will not be
able to separate us," he assured her confidently, "and
you can always rely upon my love and protection. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
am sure the Austrians and Hungarians will take my
lovely bride to their hearts."</p>

<p>With the venue settled upon there was only one thing
more to do, and that was for the archduke to send for
"a few thousand marks" for the expenses of their
wedding and subsequent honeymoon. He spoke so
glibly of his immense fortune that poor Maria did not
dare to refer to the fifty thousand marks she had in
the bank at Essen. However, he spared her any embarrassment
by laughingly advising her to take whatever
money she had out of the German banks in case "the
Emperor, my uncle, should try to deprive you of it."
Maria accordingly sent instructions to her bankers,
and shortly she had two thousand five hundred pounds
in her possession, but only for a short time, for she
handed it over to "Franz" for safe keeping on his
suggestion.</p>

<p>The portly housekeeper and the melancholy archduke
stole out of Aix-la-Chapelle late one night, and,
travelling by a circuitous route, reached London two
days later. They were both dead tired, but nevertheless
very happy, and for the time being the Austrian heir
seemed to have become another man. He could laugh
and joke and talk rapturously of the love he bore his
bride, and he was all impatience for their brief journey
to the register office in the neighbourhood of the Strand.</p>

<p>London was crowded at the time. In the previous
June Queen Victoria had celebrated her Diamond
Jubilee, and if all the royalties had departed there were
sufficient notable sight-seers from all corners of the
earth to make the great city more than usually
interesting.</p>

<p>"It is the best time for us," said the archduke, beaming
upon Maria as they prepared to leave the hotel
for the register office. "These Londoners have had
so much royalty in their midst lately that they won't
trouble to bother about me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
The dingy register office seemed to Maria Hussmann
a veritable Fairyland setting for her romance when she
stood beside Francis Ferdinand, and the wheezy official
turned them into man and wife in the most matter-of-fact
manner. She regretted that they had to give
false names, but she was well aware that that small
fraud would not invalidate the marriage.</p>

<p>A couple of clerks, called in, and rewarded with
half a sovereign each, officiated as witnesses, and then
Maria and her princely husband went out into the
sunshine and tried to realize that the wonderful event
had happened.</p>

<p>They had a merry little lunch for two at the Savoy
Hotel, and in the afternoon they went for a drive through
London. At night they had a box at one of the principal
theatres, and Francis Ferdinand talked of taking her
down to Windsor to see the Queen.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty has a womanly heart, and she will
sympathize with us," he declared. How Maria's heart
beat when she listened to him talking so familiarly
of the crowned heads of Europe! "She'll stand by us,
and she's the most powerful woman in the world. I
know Wilhelm will bluster and Nicholas shed tears
over my supposed loss of dignity, but I don't care."</p>

<p>Maria had agreed to keep their marriage a secret
until her husband had chosen the right moment to
break the news to his uncle, the Emperor Francis Joseph,
and what with daily drives, visits to the theatres, and
exciting plans for a tour of the Courts of Europe, she
let a whole week go by in London without having broken
her promise. Yet she wished that she could tell some
of the people at the <i>Savoy</i>, especially those fashionable
dames who were in the habit of regarding her with unfavourable
looks. It would make them treat her
respectfully. It was all very well for Francis Ferdinand
to wish for privacy, but she was crazy with anxiety
to astonish Europe with news of her exploit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
She must have dropped hints in the hearing of her
maid, for between lunch and afternoon tea at the <i>Savoy</i>
one mild September day she found a pleasant-mannered
gentleman beside her, who opened a conversation, and
deftly extracted a statement from her concerning her
husband. This person happened to be a journalist,
and, the same day, the wires were busy conveying the
startling information that the heir to the throne of
Austria had married Maria Hussmann, Frederick Krupp's
lady housekeeper!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bridegroom had also read the statement
in a London paper, and without a trace of annoyance
had questioned his wife. Maria confessed that
she had been unable to resist the temptation to proclaim
her pride and happiness, and he did not reprove her
harshly. It was only human, after all, he said, for
girls do not marry archdukes every day, so he kissed
her and went downstairs, and she never saw him again.</p>

<p>A third person read about the affair with, perhaps,
more interest than anybody else, and he was the real
Francis Ferdinand. He was staying at his palace in
Hungary, and the announcement of his marriage tickled
even his dormant sense of humour. Three years were
to elapse before he was to become the husband of the
Countess Sophy Chotek, later Duchess of Hohenberg,
and seventeen ere their double murder was to precipitate
the greatest of all wars.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in exposing the fraud, but
when a detective from Scotland Yard called at the hotel
he found only a weeping bride. Her husband had disappeared,
and she was desolate. The truth was broken
to her, and a benevolent lady in London made arrangements
for her to return to Essen. The authorities
had no use for her now. Their energies were concentrated
on discovering the retreat of the impostor.</p>

<p>His history was a peculiar one. Johann Schmidt&mdash;his
real name&mdash;was the son of a Berlin bookmaker, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
after numerous terms of imprisonment had become an
inmate of a criminal lunatic asylum. He escaped from
this prison by impersonating one of the doctors, and,
having made his way to Aix-la-Chapelle, wooed and
won the impressionable lady housekeeper from Essen.</p>

<p>The impostor was not, however, brought to trial,
as Maria would not prosecute him. All she wished
was to be allowed to bury herself in obscurity. But
she was scarcely more annoyed than the Chauvinistic
German journalists that her husband was not the real
Simon Pure.</p>

<p>"No wonder he could pose so successfully as Francis
Ferdinand," one of them wrote, "he was for six years
in a lunatic asylum."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BOGUS SIR RICHARD DOUGLAS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">The</span> most remarkable fact about Richard Douglas,
professional swindler, was that he kept a
record of every one of his crimes, as well as
a profit-and-loss balance-sheet, which he drew up at
the end of each year. His diary was an astonishing
document, and had it not been for the craft and obvious
guilt of the impostor it might have been used as evidence
to prove that he was not quite right in his head. Douglas,
however, was too resourceful a thief to be a lunatic,
and for some years he victimized all classes in London,
where he posed as a baronet and committed depredations
upon the trusting and unsuspicious.</p>

<p>The impostor was a man of venerable aspect, with
kindly blue eyes and a soft, ingratiating manner. He
was born with the name of Douglas, but as his father
was a small tradesman in a Surrey village Richard
thought he had better disown him, and when he had
failed many times to earn an honest living he blazoned
forth as "Sir Richard Douglas of Orpington House,
Kent," and made his two elder sons partners in his
criminal enterprises.</p>

<p>He was an insinuating rascal, and the tradespeople
whom he interviewed were easily taken in by his plausible
tongue. When he went to a well-known jeweller in
Bond Street to select a "present for my wife, Lady
Douglas," he had not the slightest difficulty in persuading
the merchant to let him have a five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
guinea diamond necklace on approval. Most swindlers
would have been content to disappear with the necklace
and realize its value, but "Sir Richard" was more
ambitious and greedy, for he was back again in the
shop the same afternoon, and, greatly to the gratification
of the jeweller, announced that "her ladyship" had
been fascinated by the necklace, and that he wished to
pay for it there and then.</p>

<p>The impostor drew a cheque for six hundred pounds,
and, remarking that his own bank would be closed
before he could get to it, induced the jeweller to give
him a receipt for the necklace and seventy-five pounds
in cash. Of course, the cheque came back marked
"No account," and not for many a long day did he
see his customer again.</p>

<p>While the "baronet" was busy on swindles of this
nature his two sons were equally active. They lacked,
of course, the suave polish of their father, but they
were bright, intelligent youths, and they could pose
as army officers anxious to spend the generous allowance
their father, "Sir Richard Douglas," made them.
The credulous traders willingly cashed cheques for
the young Douglases, and were left eventually with
bits of paper as their only souvenirs of their simplicity
and trustfulness.</p>

<p>A few months' swindling provided Douglas with
sufficient capital to rent an expensive house at Ascot,
which became his headquarters, and it was to it that
he would retire every week-end from the stress and
strain of London. Every Monday morning, however,
he would be driven in his carriage to the station to
catch the train to London, and to start another week's
"work." He dressed for each swindle, and played
many characters. On one occasion after having entertained
some of the leading people at Ascot to dinner
he returned to town the following morning, donned the
attire of a broken-down clergyman, and cajoled a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
sum from the credulous by a story of ill-health and
poverty and a starving wife and children. But generally
he was the well-dressed man of the world, and
boldly swindled tradespeople under the name of "Sir
Richard Douglas."</p>

<p>He had, of course, many narrow escapes. Once
he absent-mindedly entered a jeweller's shop&mdash;diamonds
and gold and silver articles specially appealed
to him, because they were easily convertible into hard
cash&mdash;which he had defrauded only a fortnight earlier.
The moment the proprietor saw him he identified him
as the man who had given a worthless cheque in exchange
for a diamond ring worth a hundred and fifty guineas,
but he pretended not to recognize the self-styled
"baronet," and he entered into negotiations with
"Sir Richard," who was plainly on the warpath again.
Now Douglas had that morning told his elder son,
Philip, to hang about in the vicinity of the shop, so
that when he emerged from it he might unostentatiously
pass on to him the spoils, as the impostor intended
to steal a few rings, as well as obtain others by false
pretences. The wary jeweller, however, was so unusually
alert that "Sir Richard" realized the situation.</p>

<p>He was in a tight corner now, for in addition to the
presence of the proprietor of the shop a brawny assistant
was keeping guard at the door. The "baronet," however,
exhibited no sign of fear or mental distress. He
just casually glanced out of the window, and raised his
handkerchief to his left cheek and brushed it lightly.
It was a signal to his son on the other side of the road,
and it meant that he was in difficulties.</p>

<p>Philip Douglas was a real chip of the old block, and
in a moment he devised a plan to save his venerable
parent. Walking briskly into the shop where "Sir
Richard" was the only customer&mdash;of course, the impostor
always selected the least busiest part of the
day for his frauds&mdash;he peremptorily laid his hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
his father's arm, and in curt tones expressed his delight
at having at last captured him.</p>

<p>"It's a bit of luck for you that I was passing and
recognized this fellow," he said to the astonished jeweller.
"Do you know that he is one of the greatest
swindlers in London? I have been looking for him for
over a year. Take my advice and see if he has robbed
you of anything."</p>

<p>Immediately the door was locked, and the "detective"
and the other two men stood round the pale-faced and
trembling culprit, who at that very moment held in
his hands a diamond tiara which was worth a thousand
pounds. But he was so terrified now that he seemed
not to know where he was and what he was doing.</p>

<p>The jeweller was so excited at the prospect of getting
even with the man who had swindled him a fortnight
before that he instantly preferred a charge against
"Sir Richard," and, furthermore, at the suggestion of
the "detective" added another one, accusing him of
trying to obtain the tiara by false pretences. This
was just what both the rogues wanted.</p>

<p>"Then you will be good enough to make a parcel
of that tiara," said the "detective," with an air of
authority which was irresistible. "You will carefully
seal it too. I shall have to hand it over to my superior
officer to be used as evidence at the trial. Of course
I will give you a receipt for it."</p>

<p>The jeweller hastened to obey, and ten minutes later
Philip Douglas left the shop and stepped into a four-wheeler
with his father and the diamond tiara. The
"detective" shouted out the address of a police station,
nodded curtly to the jeweller, and drove off. That
night at Ascot the family gloated over the acquisition
of a prize which would bring them in six hundred pounds
at least, and leave a big profit for the receiver of stolen
goods.</p>

<p>But the biggest <i>coup</i> of all was achieved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
"baronet" posing as a messenger. It happened that
he was chatting with the manager of a diamond merchants
shop when the latter observed that Lady Chesterfield
had given them an order to reset a collection of
very valuable stones which she had just received under
the will of a relative. They were reputed to be worth
twenty thousand pounds, and that afternoon the manager
was to call at her ladyship's town house to receive
the precious parcel. On hearing this "Sir Richard"
brought the interview to an end, murmured that he
was due back at his country seat to entertain a Cabinet
Minister and his wife, and having got outside rushed
to the nearest post office, obtained Lady Chesterfield's
address, and drove to it. His respectable appearance
was in his favour, and he was admitted at once, but
her ladyship's secretary would not hear of handing
over the diamonds until "the manager" established
his identity. It was a critical moment, and had Douglas
not been an accomplished swindler he would have
bolted, but he held his ground, and by sheer personal
magnetism won the secretary over. He had a good
memory, and he was able to recall many of the statements
the manager had made to him, retailing intimate
details of previous transactions with Lady Chesterfield
which convinced the secretary that he was what
he represented himself to be.</p>

<p>Within a week the whole of the stones were in the
possession of a well-known Continental "fence," whose
place of business was in Amsterdam, and the Douglas
banking account was increased by nine thousand pounds.
Every morning for weeks the happy family at Ascot
enjoyed the newspaper references to the great mystery,
and congratulated themselves that the secretary's and
the manager's descriptions of the swindler resembled
anybody but the bogus "baronet."</p>

<p>Continual success so impressed the impostor that
he came to the conclusion that he was under the special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
protection of Providence. He began a diary, and the
entries that followed were both amusing and amazing.
Some are worth reproducing, for the police subsequently
captured two of these astonishing compilations, which
gave a complete history of his swindles and impostures.</p>

<p>"Jan. 5th. Phaeton and horse seized. Fear exposure
at Ascot, and chance up there. Fear we must
cut."</p>

<p>"Jan. 7th. All day ill. Row about stable. Forcible
possession taken of it. Row all day with one person
or another. Fearful how things will end. Three boys
at home idle, all ordering things."</p>

<p>"Jan. 18th. Went to boys' to dinner. Champagne.
Very merry. Providence not quite deserted us."</p>

<p>When he raised three hundred pounds in two days
by means of worthless cheques he celebrated the
"triumph" by writing in his diary:</p>

<p>"My labours ended for the week. Over three hundred
to the good. Paid off local tradesmen&mdash;genuine
cheques. Gave notice to cook. Must get some one
who understands serving fish. Looking forward to a
quiet week-end. Must read Bible regularly."</p>

<p>He was really fond of reading the Bible, and he spent
his leisure at his home in studying it and keeping his
diary up to date. When his sons went off to the races
he would potter about in the garden, apparently the
most respectable and virtuous man in the kingdom.</p>

<p>But every Monday morning Douglas would descend
upon London, and when the diaries were bulging with
records of swindles of all descriptions, and almost every
tradesman in the West End was on his guard, he turned
for a time to begging-letter writing, at which he proved
himself an adept. He was the starving widow with
eight children; the lonely widow of an Indian officer;
the one-legged and one-armed hero of half a dozen
campaigns; the old woman who had worked for the
poor all her life, and was now in poverty herself; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
a dozen other characters. These rôles produced plenty
of money, not large sums, but enough to pay expenses
at Ascot and pass the time until "Sir Richard Douglas"
and his greater misdeeds were forgotten by the public
if not by his victims.</p>

<p>On one occasion he resumed his clerical garb, and
went round collecting subscriptions for an aged missionary
and his wife. By working ten hours a day for
a fortnight he collected several hundred pounds, and
he even persuaded two bishops to contribute through
their chaplains, although as a rule bishops are very
careful to make inquiries before patronizing anything
of this sort. Douglas' sympathetic air, however, clinched
the matter, and by showing the bishops' subscriptions
he was able subsequently to swindle scores of persons
who would not otherwise have been taken in.</p>

<p>By now the police were on the look out for the bogus
baronet who had ruined more than one shopkeeper
by his frauds. But Douglas was a quick-change artist,
and his keen eyes were ever on the watch. He walked
freely about London, and he always spotted the detectives,
and decamped before they recognized him. Some
of the best sleuths were put on his track, but he fooled
them all.</p>

<p>He was once tracked to a house where he was trying
to persuade the occupant, a rich old lady, to buy a tract
of land in Scotland which he did not own, and it seemed
certain that the impostor would be captured, but,
scenting danger, he ran upstairs into a room, where he
found some female clothes, and shortly afterwards
he walked through the kitchen&mdash;where a policeman
was keeping guard&mdash;and out of the house by the side
door. The policeman explained later that he thought
"she was the cook going for her afternoon out."</p>

<p>This escape, however, was so narrow that the
"baronet" returned at once to Ascot, and lay low for
a month. Meanwhile, his sons had been making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
money fly. Thousands of pounds went to the bookmakers
at Ascot and other racecourses, and all three
of them were engaged to girls with expensive tastes,
which had to be satisfied. No wonder the old hypocrite
recorded in his diary:</p>

<p>"It is sad to think of the extravagance of youth.
If we misuse the money Providence has given us we will
experience poverty. I have spoken seriously to the
boys, but they will not heed me. Note. Special hopes
for the success of the A.T. scheme."</p>

<p>The latter was, however, not successful, for it was
an attempt at a religious swindle which failed owing
to the activities of the police.</p>

<p>Another failure was his short-lived matrimonial
agency, which was to be stocked with three "baronets,"
who were supposed to be on the look out for wives.
The "baronets" were to be impersonated by his sons.
It came to an abrupt termination by the theft of the
preliminary prospectus by a servant, who had to be
bought off later at a cost of five hundred pounds, an
item of expenditure which nearly broke the old man's
heart, according to his diary.</p>

<p>These and other matters contrived to make "Sir
Richard" nervy. His sons were devoting more time
to pleasure than to business, and the knowledge that
the authorities were doubling their efforts to catch him
was ever-disturbing. But he could not remain inactive,
for his brain was always teeming with plans for swindles,
and he entered details of several in his diary, some of
which he put into execution.</p>

<p>Amongst his acquaintances in London was a widow
of fortune. She was in the late fifties, but despite
that was not averse to marrying again, especially a
man with a title, and "Sir Richard's" advances were
not repulsed. Mrs. MacCormack had been left ten
thousand a year by her husband, and the lady maintained
a costly establishment in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
of London. Douglas was fascinated by her money.
He knew that once she was his wife he would be able
to get complete control of her and her fortune. She
would obey him implicitly, and he could live at his ease,
make his sons handsome allowances, and thoroughly
enjoy life.</p>

<p>He therefore proposed to Mrs. MacCormack, who
accepted "Sir Richard" with an emotion akin to
enthusiasm, and immediately began to prepare to go
through the marriage ceremony a second time. But
Douglas insisted upon the engagement being kept a
secret, pointing out that it was only for her sake that
he did so.</p>

<p>"You will be accused of marrying me for my title,
dear," he said in a sympathetic tone, "and that would
hurt me terribly. Thank God, no one can accuse me
of marrying for money. Your fortune may be large,
but I think that it does not exceed the rent-roll of my
Scottish estates."</p>

<p>Mrs. MacCormack was touched by his kindly forethought,
and really kept the secret, although she was
anxious to impress her acquaintances with the fact
that she was about to become "Lady Douglas."</p>

<p>It was settled that the marriage should take place
at St. George's, Hanover Square, and "Sir Richard"
told the widow that the Archbishop of Canterbury
and the Bishop of London had promised to assist at
the ceremony if their engagements permitted. At the
last moment it happened that both these prelates were
detained elsewhere, at least Douglas said so, and to
the rector was given the honour of officiating.</p>

<p>On the morning of the ceremony "Sir Richard"
dressed himself with extreme care in the room he had
taken at the fashionable West End hotel. It was eleven
o'clock when he descended, and he was due at St. George's
at twelve. A carriage was to take him there with his
best man, who was his eldest son Philip, and the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
rogue was posing for the occasion as a friend and not
a relative of the bridegroom-baronet.</p>

<p>Now, Philip Douglas, who was keenly interested
in his father's matrimonial adventure, had out of mere
curiosity made a few inquiries about Mrs. MacCormack,
and he learnt that it was really true that she had ten
thousand pounds a year, but on the day of the ceremony
he discovered by sheer accident that under the provisions
of her late husband's will she was to be deprived of
every penny if she married again. So at half-past eleven
Philip Douglas dashed into the hotel, seized his father
by the arm, and drew him into a corner. There he confided
to the old sinner the information that he was going
to marry a woman, ancient and ugly, who would be
penniless the moment the knot was tied. "Sir Richard"
gasped, and then burst forth into imprecations against
the widow for her "deceit." With tears in his eyes
he said she had not been honest with him, and when he
had regained his composure he and his son drove away
to catch the train back to Ascot. Mrs. MacCormack
arrived in due course at St. George's, Hanover Square,
but the "baronet" never appeared, and she reached
home in tears and feeling that she was the laughing-stock
of London. Douglas entered all the details of
the misadventure in his diary, and he severely censured
the widow for not having been "honest" enough to
tell him the truth.</p>

<p>For some reason, however, the "baronet" went to
pieces after the abandonment of his wedding. Money
suddenly became scarce, and creditors more persistent.
A sheaf of debts contracted by his sons took him by
surprise, but they had to be paid, and Douglas was
left with only a few pounds in hand.</p>

<p>In the midst of the crisis he remembered having heard
about a benevolent clergyman of the name of Hamilton,
who had a large fortune, which he was in the habit of
sharing with the poor. Douglas decided that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
get a slice of it, and to achieve his purpose he became a
clergyman again. This time he was supposed to be
an elderly priest who had fallen upon evil times, and
to play the part properly he took lodgings in a slum
house owned by a friend and humble confederate.
From there he wrote to Mr. Hamilton asking him to
call upon a sick and poverty-stricken fellow-clergyman,
who had no friends and no hope left in this world.</p>

<p>The appeal was cunningly worded, and the setting
of the stage for the comedy was perfect. Douglas
knew that if only Mr. Hamilton called he would be able
to work upon his feelings to the extent of two hundred
pounds at least. Anxiously he waited for a reply, and
his joy was great when the owner of the house informed
him that a clergyman was approaching.</p>

<p>The sham priest instantly returned to bed, and assuming
a pained look prepared to receive the visitor. He
heard the knock at the front door, and braced himself
for the interview. Presently footsteps sounded on the
stairs, and then the door opened and a clergyman entered,
whose expression seemed to indicate a generous and
credulous disposition.</p>

<p>Douglas was murmuring a prayer when the clergyman
came to his side and looked down at him. Then he
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are the saintly Mr. Hamilton?" he
asked in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>"No," was the startling answer. "I am Inspector
Allen, and I hold a warrant for your arrest, Sir Richard."</p>

<p>It was a neat capture. The impostor was unable to
extricate himself, and at the ensuing Sessions he and
his sons were sentenced to imprisonment, and after
that catastrophe nothing more was heard of the venerable
swindler until a newspaper recorded his death in 1858.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ENTERPRISING MRS. CHADWICK</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">There</span> had been a sensational forgery in a
certain Canadian town, and when the police
announced that they had captured the criminal
a huge crowd sought entrance to the Court where the
case was to be tried. Those who managed to squeeze
themselves in were astonished when they saw a slim,
fair-haired girl, with dark, alluring eyes, standing in
the dock, for Lydia Bigley, aged sixteen, was the forger!</p>

<p>The magistrates could hardly believe the evidence
for the prosecution. It seemed incredible that such a
beautiful girl could be an expert forger, but the police
had accumulated all the facts, and there could be no
doubt that the demure maiden who looked so modest,
and who occasionally favoured the bench with a sweeping
glance from beneath her long eyelashes, was the
person who had tried to raise five thousand dollars
by imitating a wealthy acquaintance's signature on a
cheque.</p>

<p>The large-hearted men who judged Lydia did not intend
to send her to gaol if they could help it, and after a
brief consultation amongst themselves they acquitted
her on the ground that she must have been insane
when she committed the crime with which she had been
charged.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable decision, and it did more credit
to the magistrates' hearts than to their heads, but Lydia's
magnetic eyes may have had something to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Lydia's first escape from prison. For years afterwards
those fascinating orbs were busy at work. There were
to be greater triumphs in store for her ere she was run
to earth. The girl developed into an extraordinary
woman. When she stepped out of the dock with an
alluring smile her brain was busy evolving a method
by which she could live luxuriously without having to
work, and she deliberately chose a life of crime. For
a year or two, however, she contented herself with blackmail.
It was always easy for her to persuade some
rich man that she had lost her heart to him, then get
him into a compromising position, and afterwards
proceed to levy blackmail as the price of her silence.
The money so obtained did not provide her with more
than her current expenses, and she was anxious to
launch out as a society woman.</p>

<p>She did not, of course, confine herself to Canada.
The rich country of the United States presented a
promising field to her, and in turn she visited many
of the principal cities, where she posed in turn as the
daughter of a British general, the widow of an earl,
the niece of a former American president, and so on
until she had at one time or another claimed close
relationship with many of the mighty ones of the earth.</p>

<div id="ip_160" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_160fp.jpg" width="500" height="297" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">MRS. CHADWICK</div></div>

<p>All this, however, only prepared her for the great
and final swindle, and a very brief career as a "society
clairvoyante" in an Ohio town was merely an incident.
Lydia was much more ambitious now. It took an immense
amount of hard cash to coax fashionable dresses
and fascinating hats out of the shops, and she simply
loved both. In the hour of her desperation, when two
former victims declined to part with any more cash, and
her clairvoyance business was closed by the police, she
remembered her first exploit in criminality, and decided
to chance her luck again as a forger. But she was not
going to be content with a small sum now. She was
the most popular woman in the district where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
temporarily resided. She set the fashion, and was determined
to live up to her proud position.</p>

<p>Up to this time Lydia had not found a man sufficiently
rich to make it worth her while to marry. She had
had numerous affairs with married men, and not a
few bachelors had actually proposed to her, but there
was something against every one of them, and it was
not until she met handsome and popular and well-to-do
Dr. Leroy Chadwick, of Cleveland, that she consented
to change her name. But if she had been dangerous
as Lydia Bigley, she was doubly so as Mrs. Leroy Chadwick,
because her status as the wife of the respected
practitioner gave her almost unlimited opportunities
for swindling, and she took full advantage of them.</p>

<p>Her extravagance knew no bounds. She bought
on credit thousands of pounds worth of jewellery and
furs. If she met a girl she liked she would take her
to Europe for a pleasure trip. Once she brought four
young ladies with her to London, Paris, and the principal
Italian and German cities. The trip cost four thousand
pounds, but it was none of her cheapest experiments
in trying to get rid of money. For instance, she and
her husband occupied a large house standing in its
own grounds, which she insisted upon refurnishing,
regardless of expense. A little later she decided to
have it redecorated throughout, and she agreed to pay
a fantastic price to the contractors on the understanding
that they began and finished the work while she was
watching a performance at the local theatre! They
managed to keep their word, and Mrs. Chadwick's house
became for the time being a show place.</p>

<p>Another of her fads was a habit of giving costly
presents on the slightest provocation. To impress a
local piano dealer with her importance she walked into
his showroom one day and counted the number of
instruments he happened to have in stock. There
were twenty-seven of them all told, and Mrs. Chadwick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
promptly gave him a list of twenty-seven of her friends,
and told him to deliver one of his pianos to each with
her compliments. Although somewhat taken aback
at such an order, and hearing that Mrs. Leroy Chadwick
always paid for her eccentricity, the piano dealer dared
not doubt her word, and promised to deliver the instruments.
Again she ordered a dozen costly clocks, one
of which was made of gold, works and all. She kept
the latter for herself, and gave away the others. Her
servants came in for many of her gifts, and she decked
out her cook with so many costly clothes that the good
dame grew too big for her job, and gave notice on the
ground that the work was undignified, and tended to
ruin her wardrobe!</p>

<p>Of course, these ventures in extravagance could not
have been accomplished without a considerable amount
of ready money. American tradesmen are not all
"mugs," and no matter how beautiful Lydia Chadwick
may have been, had she not been in a position to pay
her tradesmen, they would have spoiled her little schemes
by pressing for the settlement of their accounts.</p>

<p>Dr. Chadwick could not, however, keep pace with
her expenditure, and she fell back upon forgery, and
now she began her greatest exploit, which, before it
landed her in the dock of an unsympathetic criminal
Court, enabled her to handle nearly a million dollars.</p>

<p>One day she drove in a costly carriage, with coachman
and footman in attendance, to the bank, and
with impressive dignity walked in and requested the
manager to advance the modest sum of fifty thousand
pounds. Naturally the official asked for security.
Mrs. Chadwick yawned and opened her purse bag.</p>

<p>"I presume you have heard of my uncle, Mr. Andrew
Carnegie?" she asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>The banker declared that he knew a great deal about
the millionaire, whose name will for ever be associated
with Pittsburg iron and free libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
"Well, then," said the lady, with her nose in the air,
"here are two notes signed by him. You can see they
are worth £150,000. Perhaps you consider them sufficient
security for such a paltry sum as I want you to
lend me for a few weeks."</p>

<p>They were, of course, ample security, but the manager,
a shrewd business man, determined to take no risks.
He, therefore, politely hinted that while he would not
dare to doubt the genuineness of the signature of the
famous millionaire, "just for form's sake," he would
like to have a responsible person swear that the writing
was Mr. Carnegie's. He rather expected Mrs. Chadwick
to be offended, but she merely told him that the gentleman
who had delivered the notes to her that morning
was still in town. "And as he is Mr. Carnegie's New
York lawyer I think he ought to know his handwriting."</p>

<p>The lawyer was fetched, and he not only identified
the signatures, but added the overwhelming testimony
that he had been present himself when Mr. Carnegie
had drawn up and signed the notes. After that there
was nothing to be done but to credit Mrs. Chadwick
with fifty thousand pounds, and deposit the precious
securities in the safe.</p>

<p>A month later the whole of the money had evaporated.
Clamouring tradesmen had had to be satisfied, advances
from money-lenders liquidated, and scores of persons
to be impressed by large orders for various goods, for
which cash was paid. Meanwhile the Carnegie notes
rested securely in the strong room of the bank, for it
was some time ere the manager was to know that they
were worthless forgeries, and that Mrs. Chadwick did
not know Mr. Carnegie, neither had she ever seen him
in her life!</p>

<p>Mrs. Chadwick certainly displayed a very masculine
ability in her criminal exploits. It was a stroke of
genius to carry a bunch of important-looking papers
to one of the leading banks, and hire a special safe by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the year, for the rent of which she obtained a receipt.
Armed with this she was able to persuade quite a number
of rich and fashionable Americans that she had a million
pounds worth of securities in the safe which she did
not wish to dispose of because the markets were low,
and to sell out would have been to invite a heavy loss.
She varied her story as occasion demanded, one of her
favourite yarns being that the securities were bequeathed
to her on the condition that she did not sell them outright.
She could, however, promise very large interest
to those who trusted her, and it was an offer to pay
twenty per cent that induced one millionaire to hand
her his cheque for two hundred thousand dollars and not
ask for anything more than a written receipt.</p>

<p>Her swindle was, of course, only a copy of the Humbert
fraud, and, considering that she put it into operation
a year after the sentence on the famous Madame
Humbert, it is extraordinary that she should have been
able to find victims. The only explanation that has
been advanced is that of hypnotism. Mrs. Chadwick
had undoubtedly "hypnotic eyes," but it is doubtful
if they alone charmed nearly a million out of some of
the most astute business men the land of dollars has
produced.</p>

<p>But her story of a vast fortune in a bank safe was
generally believed. When she informed a keen-witted
New York millionaire that if he advanced her twenty-five
thousand dollars she would repay him twice as
much within the year&mdash;the safe, she declared, was to
be opened on a certain date, and the contents distributed
as she decided&mdash;he actually took her word, and parted
with the money he was never to see again. And this
did not happen long ago. The date of the transaction
was 1904, and that same man must have read all about
Madame Humbert's trial and conviction less than twelve
months previously.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give further particulars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
this "safe" fraud. Mrs. Chadwick simply took the
cash, and had a "high old time," and day and night
her mansion was filled with guests. Her tradespeople
were delighted. The fact that she paid them cash,
and that most of them were too wary to take "shares"
in the "safe" exploit, proved that some people at
any rate ultimately benefited by the woman's amazing
imposture.</p>

<p>One of her most fiendish exploits was to invite a well-known
financier to dine with her and a few friends.
This gentleman had declined to advance money on
the strength of the mythical securities, and she had
resolved to get even with him. She therefore retained
friendly relations with him and unsuspectingly he
accepted her invitation. When he arrived Mrs. Chadwick's
only other guest was a pretty young girl, the
daughter of a New York physician.</p>

<p>The dinner was a pleasant affair, but towards the
close the financier became sleepy, greatly to his surprise,
as he did not suspect that his hostess had purposely
drugged both him and her only other guest. Anyhow,
in the early morning, when he woke up, he found himself
stretched on the floor, and a moment later Mrs. Chadwick
appeared, and tearfully explained that in his
"excited condition"&mdash;she meant intoxicated, but refrained
from using that vulgar word&mdash;he had grossly
insulted her girl friend. The long and the short of it
was that he had to pay ten thousand dollars in blackmail,
and of this sum the woman gave her girl confederate
two hundred.</p>

<p>But at last the morning dawned when a certain victim
of hers set out for the Wade National Bank in Cleveland,
and presented the manager's receipt for the hire of the
safe, together with the key and a written order from
Mrs. Chadwick that the bearer was to be permitted
to open the safe and take from it the valuable securities
she had deposited there. Her emissary was a creditor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
to the extent of eighty thousand dollars, and he was
naturally very anxious to recoup himself for his outlay.
Mrs. Chadwick had instructed him to select sufficient
stocks and shares to realize his account plus twenty
thousand dollars for interest, and then to send the rest
to a firm of stockbrokers in New York with instructions
to realize.</p>

<p>It must have been a very dramatic moment when the
credulous creditor turned the key in the lock and the
safe door opened on its hinges, and he must have felt
pleased with himself when he saw the pile of important-looking
documents which seemed to him to be valuable
share certificates. But a moment later he realized
that he had been grossly swindled, for the papers proved
to be worthless.</p>

<p>The bubble had burst! Mrs. Chadwick was from that
moment known as the Madame Humbert of America.
How her creditors howled! How they were chaffed
and ridiculed! A few would not reveal themselves
once they guessed that there could be no redress. Nevertheless,
stern measures were adopted, and a warrant
was issued for the impostor's arrest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chadwick had taken up her quarters in an
expensive hotel in the early part of December, 1904.
She intended to pass Christmas there, and the management
had already consulted her as to her ideas of a
really Christmasy entertainment. She was paying one
hundred dollars a week for her rooms, and she had
arrived with a fortune in jewels, and half a dozen personal
servants. She was the uncrowned queen of the
hotel, where the other visitors stood in groups and
discussed her wonderful personality in awed accents.</p>

<p>She was destined, however, to spend that Christmas
in gaol. One evening when Mrs. Chadwick, resplendent
in a marvellous Parisian creation, and wearing jewels
which must have cost fifty thousand dollars at least,
was chatting at the dinner-table, the manager came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
her and respectfully intimated that a couple of gentlemen
wished to see her. She graciously answered that
she would receive them in her drawing-room. Visitors
were every-day occurrences with her, and these, she
thought, were local celebrities, who had come to enlist
her support for their Christmas charities.</p>

<p>Without the slightest suspicion that anything was
wrong she entered her luxurious drawing-room, and
with a smile inquired the strangers' business. Now
American detectives have a habit of being brutally
frank, and they lost no time in informing her that she
was their prisoner, and that the charge against her
was that of having obtained nearly a million dollars
by fraud.</p>

<p>The news stunned her, and for a moment or two
she stood motionless. Then she collapsed in a faint,
and it was some time before the two detectives could
get her downstairs and into the waiting cab.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chadwick had started her criminal career with
a triumph over the soft-hearted Canadian magistrates
who had so obligingly decided that she was too pretty
to be evil, and, recalling that triumph, she resolved to
fight for her liberty with her eyes and not her tongue.
When she was brought into the dock she fainted again,
knowing that she looked quite bewitching when in that
state, and that her forlorn condition must wring pity
from even her worst enemies. But her programme
did not work out as she expected it would. Instead
of a host of sympathetic men crowding round her and
proffering good-natured advice, she was roughly brought
to by a couple of hard-featured wardresses. Then she
was installed in the dock again, and compelled to listen
to the story of her life as told by a prosecuting lawyer,
who was quite unaffected by Mrs. Chadwick's "magnetic
eyes." He mercilessly raked up her past, recounted
how she had ruined scores of men and women, how she
had been one of the most dangerous blackmailers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
America, and how she had adopted Madame Humbert's
"safe" swindle, with disastrous results for scores of
impressionable men.</p>

<p>It was a formidable indictment, and the recital of
it blotted out at once the beauty of the prisoner. She
was shown to be an utterly unscrupulous impostor, a
woman who had declared war against society, and who
had repaid her husband's love by making his name
a byword throughout the land.</p>

<p>She had, of course, a clever lawyer to plead for her,
and every possible effort was made to secure an acquittal,
but there was no question of insanity now. She was
too clever to be an imbecile, and the judge had not the
slightest hesitation in giving her ten years' imprisonment.</p>

<p>When she had been convicted, and before she tottered
from the dock into the oblivion of the gaol, the interesting
fact was mentioned that she had been in the habit
of wearing a belt containing ten thousand dollars, with
the object of taking to flight if her liberty was ever
threatened. The celerity with which the police had
acted, however, resulted in the capture of this little
"nest egg" for her creditors, although it is to be feared
that each of them received a very small proportion
of the amount he lost through his faith in the word of
the greatest female impostor since Madame Humbert
was convicted. It should be recorded that her husband
had nothing whatever to do with her frauds. He was,
in fact, one of her victims and when he married her he
had no idea that she was then an ex-convict.</p>

<p>After the failure of her attempt to secure a new trial
Mrs. Chadwick was sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary
at Columbus, and there she died on Oct. 10th, 1907, at
the age of forty-eight.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MILLION DOLLAR RANCH GIRL</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">One</span> summer day a beautiful Mexican girl was
sitting motionless on horseback gazing across
the ranch of which her adopted father was
the owner, when a young man, tall, of good appearance,
and pleasant address, came up and respectfully raised
his cap. The girl instantly smiled a welcome, for in
that remote region strangers were few, and it was the
custom of the country to welcome and entertain them.
But this young man had no desire to be taken to the
ranch house. He wanted to have a chat with the
beauty, and as he was handsome and ingratiating the
impressionable girl readily consented to give him half
an hour of her time.</p>

<p>James Addison Beavis, for that was the stranger's
name, told a wonderful story to the dark-eyed damsel,
who listened as if spellbound.</p>

<p>"This is not the first time I have seen you," he said
in a pleasing, confidential manner that was delightfully
intimate and brotherly. "I have often watched you
galloping about on the ranch, but I wanted to be quite
certain that you are the person I have been looking for
for years before I spoke."</p>

<p>"Looking for me!" she exclaimed in wonderment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quickly, and dropped his voice. "Do
you know that your real name is Peralta, and that with
my help you will soon be the owner of lands in Arizona
and New Mexico worth one hundred million dollars?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
She gasped. Could it be possible? She was half-Spanish,
half-Mexican, and therefore hot-tempered and
romantic, and it was easy for her to persuade herself
that she was something better than the adopted daughter
of a Mexican ranch-owner, who had taken her into
his house out of pure charity. Dolores felt that she
had been meant for something better.</p>

<p>Beavis, who was a cute man of the world, and possessed
of an eloquent tongue, sat beside her on the
trunk of an old tree, and explained why it was that a
huge tract of land was awaiting an owner, land which
would make its eventual possessor a multi-millionaire.
He said that hundreds of years ago a Spanish king
had made over the rich lands of Peralta to a certain
Spanish nobleman, whose descendants had enjoyed
the revenues, until, owing to various misfortunes, there
seemed to be a lack of heirs. The property had then
been taken charge of by the United States Government,
and its revenues had been, and still were, accumulating,
but he had been inspired to make an independent research,
and he could now prove by legal documents
that Dolores was the only living descendant of the last
owner of the huge estate. He promised to produce the
necessary birth and marriage certificates which established
his contention that Dolores Peralta was the legal
proprietor of an estate half the size of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Dolores herself had only a vague idea as to how she
had become an orphan, but the fascinating and persuasive
Beavis had the whole story at his finger-ends.
He declared that when she was an infant her parents
had been drowned whilst crossing a river, and that
Dolores had been rescued by an Indian squaw, who
had later on abandoned her. After passing through
various hands she had come into the keeping of the
Mexican who had adopted her, and with him she had
spent the last fifteen of her eighteen years, passing as
his daughter, and generally understood to be his heir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
But now that she was told by Beavis that she had
only to trust her affairs to him to become worth
£20,000,000, the ranch seemed but a poor and sordid
affair and unworthy of her. She wanted to obtain her
rights and to take her place in society, and the more she
listened to Beavis the more inclined she was to give him
not only charge of her affairs, but also the keeping of
her heart. For Beavis was an expert talker, and Dolores
was not the only victim of his honeyed tongue.</p>

<p>They made a compact there and then that Beavis
was to go ahead with the task of obtaining the property
for her. Dolores had, of course, no money to advance
for expenses, but this did not worry Beavis. He went
to New York, and obtained an interview with Mackay,
the famous millionaire, who earned the name of "The
Silver King." Mr. Mackay was so impressed that he
advanced sufficient capital to enable Beavis to proceed
to Spain to prosecute his inquiries.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole affair was a barefaced swindle.
There was certainly a Peralta estate awaiting a claimant
and it was worth twenty million pounds, but Dolores,
the girl of the ranch, was not a Peralta at all. Beavis,
however, meant to get that huge fortune, even if he
had to share it with the girl. It was in his opinion a
stake well worth risking much for. He was an expert
forger, and his knowledge of human nature was immense.
Besides that he had the great gift of patience, and he
was willing to spend years if necessary perfecting his
plans before putting them into execution.</p>

<p>It was easy enough for him to forge birth, marriage
and death certificates, as well as a deed of gift conveying
the property to the Peralta family, but he wanted something
else besides documents. Dolores, who was in
reality of obscure birth, looked the aristocrat to the life.
She was undeniably beautiful, and her carriage was the
last word in haughty aloofness, though the girl was a
charming companion when with those she liked. Beavis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
had found her delightful, and whilst he was prosecuting
his inquiries in Spain he never forgot the beauty of
the lonely ranch.</p>

<p>Day after day he toured the curiosity shops of Madrid,
delving into dusty cellars and examining everything,
picture, paper, or curio, which bore the stamp of age.
Only Beavis would have devoted so much time to a
single detail when practically his case was ready, but
his perseverance was rewarded when he came upon two
ancient miniatures which were strikingly like Dolores.
They represented two Spanish ladies who had existed
a hundred years earlier, and they might have been
mother and daughter, judging by their resemblance
to one another, but they interested the impostor for
the reason that their features were exact replicas of
Dolores'.</p>

<p>From the moment they became Beavis' by purchase
he called them miniatures of two of Dolores' ancestors,
and he exhibited them as her great-great-grandmother
and a remote aunt. They were Peraltas, and bore the
Peralta cast of countenance&mdash;at least Beavis said so,
and he professed to be the only living authority on a
famous Spanish family which had come upon evil days.</p>

<p>Every week he heard from Dolores, and it ought to
have been obvious to him that the girl was thinking
less of the twenty millions than she was of her "gallant
knight errant." She was really more concerned with
his welfare than with the prospect of becoming the
richest woman in the world. Beavis smiled as he read
her somewhat artless compositions. It was the money
he was after, and he was too clever an adventurer and
impostor to have any time for love-making, although
Dolores was undoubtedly a beauty.</p>

<p>Thanks to the financial help of "The Silver King,"
Beavis was able to do his work thoroughly in Spain
before returning to the United States, and when he
arrived in New York he brought with him a pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
documents bearing on the Peralta family. The two
miniatures occupied a prominent place, and the forged
deed of gift, so skilfully executed that Beavis confidently
handed it over to experts for examination,
was also to the fore. Those who had heard of Beavis'
activities were greatly excited, for it is not often that
a claimant comes forward to an estate worth in American
money one hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>But before he came into Court on behalf of Dolores
there was one important thing to be done. Beavis
had devoted years of labour to the task. He was going
to risk a year's imprisonment, and he considered it
only right that, to make assurance doubly sure as far
as his reward was concerned, Dolores should become
his wife.</p>

<p>It was a casual remark in a New York restaurant
that decided him to propose to her. A friend, who
was a world-renowned handwriting expert, and who
had pronounced the forged deed of gift to be genuine,
laughingly tried to estimate the number of proposals
the heiress would have when it was known who and
what she was. That night Beavis took the train to the
town nearest the ranch, where by arrangement Dolores
met him to hear all about his adventures.</p>

<p>The meeting was a strange one. Beavis was full
of the subject which engrossed him day and night,
and he wanted to go at once into details, but Dolores
seemed to be uninterested in everything and everybody
except him. She wished to know how he was, and if
he was well and happy, and as she sat beside him her
dark eyes constantly travelled in his direction, and
there were tears in them sometimes.</p>

<p>Dolores was, as a matter of fact, desperately in love
with Beavis. At the back of her brain there was a
shrewd suspicion that there was no Peralta estate, and
that she was only his partner in a gigantic swindle,
but she loved him, and that was sufficient for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
It was of no importance if the Peralta property was
a myth. Beavis had won her heart, and she had spent
months of anxiety, fostered by a growing jealousy, because
she feared that in the luxurious cities of Europe
he would meet a girl who would make him forget the
wild beauty of the ranch.</p>

<p>Beavis quickly realized the situation, and with a
merry laugh and a few compliments asked her to marry
him. He was not prepared for her answer. No sooner
had he spoken than she flung herself at his feet, and
passionately announced her intention of devoting the
rest of her life to his welfare.</p>

<p>It was a real love romance within a sordid, miserable
fraud. Beavis, who prided himself upon his knowledge
of men and women, could not understand the love he
had aroused in the breast of this veritable child of
nature. He, who would have sold himself body and
soul for money, was astounded that Dolores should be
happier as his fiancée than as the prospective owner
of twenty million pounds. She would look bored
when he spoke of their future splendour when they came
into the Peralta money, but if he referred, however
obliquely, to her as his wife her face would light up
and her manner change at once into that of a happy,
delighted girl.</p>

<p>The old ranch-owner offered no objection to the
match, and the marriage promptly took place in a
remote town, none of those present being aware that
this ceremony was to be the prelude to one of the biggest
law cases in the history of the United States. Beavis
was not in love with his bride. He wanted her money,
but Dolores was enchantingly happy, and had she
not known that she would have displeased her husband
by the suggestion she would have asked him to retire
from the Peralta case and let them find and make their
own happiness in a little ranch away from the poverty
and crimes of cities. But to Beavis nothing mattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
except the Peralta millions, and the day after the marriage
ceremony he took his lovely bride to New York,
where they established themselves in one of the leading
hotels, there to await the opening of the suit before
the Court of Claims.</p>

<p>The smooth and persuasive tongue of the bridegroom
and the beauty and naturalness of the bride carried
all before them in New York. Beavis had certainly
done his work well, but when level-headed lawyers,
suspicious by nature, met Mrs. Beavis they immediately
capitulated. There is no other explanation of the
extraordinary number of adherents they made for
their cause.</p>

<p>They entertained lavishly, using the money which
their guests had subscribed for the presentation of
Dolores' case before the Courts. It might have been
supposed that the ranch girl would have been at a
disadvantage in such society, coming as she did from
the heart of prairie-land, but because she insisted upon
being herself she scored social triumph after social
triumph.</p>

<p>The impostor was, of course, the happiest man in
New York. It seemed impossible that he should fail.
In fact, everybody agreed that the trial would be the
most formal of affairs. His cleverness and Dolores'
beauty were irresistible, and he would have to be a
hard-headed, unfeeling judge who could resist the
appeal her eyes made.</p>

<p>Backed by some of the leading business people in
New York, his case, presented by a firm of lawyers
justly renowned for its ability, and with his wife to cheer
him on, Beavis went into Court certain that he would
leave it one of the richest men in America. Dolores
and he sat side by side whilst counsel argued before
the judges and endeavoured to prove that the adopted
daughter of the Mexican ranch-owner was the descendant
of the Counts of Peralta, who had originally come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Spain. Beavis gave his evidence with confidence and,
of course, courage. When a man is playing for such a
stake as twenty millions he requires both in abundance.</p>

<p>The end of the first day of the case foreshadowed
an easy victory. Beavis was overjoyed, and Dolores
was happy just because he was. By now, however,
she had seen enough of the documents to guess that
the whole claim was bogus. She was the daughter
of nameless parents, and, no matter what the Court
decided, she would never know who her forbears really
were. It did not matter much to her, yet because
she loved the impostor she became even more anxious
for success than he was, and she knew that if anything
went wrong it would break her heart.</p>

<p>Had the estate not been so enormous the United
States Court of Claims would not have so doggedly
resisted Beavis' claim, but the officials realized that
it would be best for all concerned if the question of
ownership was decided once and for all. Because of
that they took the precaution to despatch an expert
in pedigrees and old documents to Madrid, to go over
the ground that Beavis had covered and to inquire
especially into the history of the all-important deed
of gift.</p>

<p>The claimant was not aware of this, if he had been
it might have disturbed the serenity with which he
faced the Court. But everything was going his way,
and there was always his lovely and devoted wife to
whisper that they were winning and that their suspense
would soon be ended.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if there has ever been a case where
an impostor has failed by such a narrow margin as
Beavis did. The Government officials had been receiving
regular reports from their emissary in Spain, and each
one strengthened rather than weakened the claimant's
case; accordingly, the presiding judge was actually
drawing up a judgment in favour of Dolores when at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
eleventh hour a report came from Madrid which pointed
to the fact that the Government agent had discovered
that Beavis' deed of gift was a barefaced forgery.</p>

<p>Once that was known there was, of course, no chance
for the impostor. It naturally followed that the history
of all the other documents presented by Beavis was
inquired into, and then the system of wholesale forgery
came to light. Step by step his progress in his greatest
imposture was traced. His numerous birth, death
and marriage certificates were shown to be worthless;
the dealer who had sold the miniatures to him was
produced, and gave damaging evidence, and the impostor
was left without a leg to stand upon.</p>

<p>The case came to a dramatic finish, the judge announcing
unexpectedly that it was dismissed. The Court
gasped. Beavis pretended to be astonished, and he
glanced around with a smiling face, but his eyes were
searching for detectives, and he identified two in the
men who now stood by the door of the Court. They
posed as ushers, but the impostor realized that their
business was never to let him out of their sight until
they had clapped him into a cell.</p>

<p>Poor Dolores was most affected by his arrest, which
Beavis chose to regard as an official blunder and one
which he would soon put right. The girl who loved
him, however, knew that it would be a long time ere
he was free again. He would have to pay the penalty
for his gigantic imposture, and as she thought of the
years of separation her tears flowed.</p>

<p>As in the case of the claim to the Peralta estate,
Beavis bore himself well at the criminal trial. It was,
of course, easy for the prosecution to prove his guilt,
and the leading citizens who had backed him felt particularly
foolish when they understood how they had
been tricked. It was, perhaps, only human that Dolores
should find herself without a friend when the judge
sentenced her husband to a long term of imprisonment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
The society that had fawned upon and flattered her
now gave her the cold shoulder. But the lonely wife
did not mind. She had determined to work hard and
wait patiently until the man she loved returned to her.</p>

<p>Some years ago when an English nobleman was
sentenced to five years' penal servitude his wife took
up her residence as near as possible to the gaol in which
he was incarcerated. Dolores Beavis went one better.
She toiled so that she might have the means to start
her husband in business when he came out of gaol;
and to achieve her object she underwent toil and trouble
and insult.</p>

<p>When, later, he was removed to another gaol she
would give up her employment and follow on foot,
afraid to spend any of her savings on railways, and
denying herself sufficient food in order that the precious
"nest-egg" might not be diminished.</p>

<p>Beavis knew what she was doing for him, and the
knowledge of it changed his nature. Money ceased
to be his god. He had not appreciated Dolores when
he had her all to himself, but whilst he sat in his lonely
cell and remembered that she was outside the gloomy
gaol working herself to the bone for him his nature
softened, and he fell in love with her. Better men
have inspired less devotion; fewer have known such
love as Dolores bestowed upon the man to whom she
had surrendered her heart.</p>

<p>Once Beavis, maddened by inaction, determined to
escape, and he managed to communicate his intention
to his wife. She implored him not to make the attempt,
which would be certain to fail, and which would therefore
result in an addition to his term of imprisonment.
He took her advice, and a day later found that one of
the party of convicts who had planned a simultaneous
dash for freedom was a spy in the pay of the governor
of the prison, so that there never had been the slightest
chance of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
But even the longest sentence must come to an end,
and after a period of separation which had seemed like
eternity to both of them Beavis walked out of the
prison gates a free man. The first person he saw was
Dolores, dressed simply in black and looking more
beautiful than ever. Without a word they went away
arm in arm to begin life anew.</p>

<p>Beavis had a sense of humour, and he must have
realized the funny side of the scene when Dolores proudly
told him that she had scraped together the large sum
of forty-eight dollars! To the man who had once refused
to think of anything under a million this was a
descent from the sublime to the ridiculous, yet the
impostor, who had paid for his sins, could find himself
regarding her fortune with enthusiasm, and he could
spend hours debating as to the best way to lay it out
with advantage to themselves.</p>

<p>It was Dolores who decided their future. She had
been brought up on a ranch and away from the crowded
centres, so she voted for a small farm in a remote corner
of the great United States, and Beavis willingly submitted.
The Peralta estate and its twenty million
pounds seemed like a dream now, and he would not
have troubled to devote even an hour to a similar
scheme even if it promised to produce twice as much.</p>

<p>Thus it was his wife's love that saved James Addison
Beavis from himself, and made his name unfamiliar
to the police. His one great adventure in crime had
met with disaster, and ever afterwards he was content
with the fortune the labour of his hands earned for him.</p>

<span class="subhead">JAMES GREENACRE</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">According</span> to his own description of himself,
James Greenacre was a very respectable grocer,
a lenient creditor, and one of the most popular
residents in the parish of Camberwell; and to prove
the latter statement he pointed to the fact that he had
been elected one of the overseers of the parish by a
substantial majority.</p>

<p>But the plain truth is that, during the greater part
of the fifty-two years which comprised his span of life,
Greenacre was a hypocritical scoundrel who preached
virtue and practised vice and whose egregious vanity
found an outlet in seconding the notoriety-seeking
eccentricities of politicians of the Daniel Whittle Harvey
type. Greenacre presided at Harvey's meetings when
the latter was Radical candidate for Southwark, and
there is a certain grim humour in the fact that three years
after Greenacre was executed for murder his political
confrère was appointed commissioner of the metropolitan
police. Greenacre was prospering when an
offence against the inland revenue entailed unpremeditated
emigration to America, and after a brief sojourn
in New York and Boston he returned to London in
1835 and began the manufacture of "an infallible remedy
for throat and chest disorders." He was struggling to
make this venture pay when he met Hannah Browne.</p>

<p>Greenacre had regained his reputation for solvency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
when he astonished his numerous friends by hinting
that he would not mind undergoing the ordeal of matrimony
if a woman with plenty of money could be found
for him. He said that, as he was a rich man, it would be
only fair if the other party to the contract brought a fair
fortune into the common pool. In fact, with him marriage
was a business deal and nothing else, and he made
no secret of his opinion.</p>

<p>There were plenty of girls and matrons in Camberwell
who would not have objected to becoming Mrs. James
Greenacre, but they all lacked the necessary qualification
for the partner of the prosperous quack and politician,
and their dreams of wealth soon faded. Greenacre, however,
kept a sharp lookout, and one evening he casually
made the acquaintance of a widow named Hannah
Browne. She was between thirty-five and forty and
ever since childhood had toiled laboriously. Even a
short spell of married life had brought her no relief,
for the late Mr. Browne had had an incurable objection
to work, and his unfortunate wife had been the breadwinner
for both of them. But Mrs. Browne was apparently
a cheerful and free-from-care person when she
was introduced to the avaricious rascal. If she was not
exactly a beauty, she had features which were pleasing,
and she possessed sufficient womanly tact to make the
most of Greenacre's weak points. She flattered him as
much as she could; dwelt on his popularity and his
fearlessness as a politician&mdash;he was a stentor of the
street-corner&mdash;and, doubtless, predicted that one day
he would be a Member of Parliament. He swallowed the
flattery, large as the doses were; but, while he liked Mrs.
Browne for the sensible woman that she was, he did not
forget the qualification he demanded from the person
who aspired to become his wife. He had been particularly
touched, however, by her references to his fame as a
politician, for Greenacre was a self-styled champion of
the people, and in Camberwell his voice was often raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
in denunciation of those eminent statesmen with whose
views he did not agree. It was a time of general unrest
in home affairs, and four years previously the great
Reform Bill of 1832 had started the movement which
eventually was to give the electors the complete control
of Parliament.</p>

<p>Mrs. Browne resolved to marry the grocer and share
his savings, and to impress Greenacre she invented a story
of house property which she, a helpless widow, found
difficult to manage. She told him she had been left
some houses by Mr. Browne and that these with her
savings made her fairly well off. Greenacre succumbed
to the temptation; proposed and was accepted.</p>

<p>It was now late autumn, Christmas was approaching,
and Hannah Browne complained of feeling lonely. Her
only relative, a brother, who lived near Tottenham Court
Road, had his own interests, and she was without a real
friend. The widow's object was to get the marriage
ceremony over as quickly as possible, for every day's delay
increased the danger of Greenacre's discovery of her
lies. She was confident that once she was his wife she
would be all right. He might be angry; perhaps threaten
her; but his standing in Camberwell would compel
him to accept her as his wife and give her the shelter
of his house, and she and Time would do the rest. Anyhow,
the risk was small compared with the benefits to be
gained by a successful issue to her plot. She had had
enough of hard work, poverty and loneliness. So all
through the courtship she lied and lied, and the mercenary
rogue believed her because he wanted those
houses and meant to have them at any price.</p>

<p>Urged by him Hannah Browne named a day for the
wedding&mdash;the last Wednesday of the year, 1836&mdash;and to
celebrate her decision Greenacre invited her to dine with
him on Christmas Eve at his own house. He promised
her that his housekeeper, Sarah Gale, would prepare a
meal which would do credit to the occasion, and Hannah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
gladly accepted, delighted as she was at the success of her
scheme to secure a well-to-do husband.</p>

<p>What would her brother and his family say now?
She glowed with gratification when she pictured their
amazement when she told them that she was the wife
of a prosperous trader and property-owner! The years
of humiliation would be wiped out by her second marriage.
Her first had been a failure, but the second would
more than compensate for it.</p>

<p>In the early part of the day before Christmas she met
several acquaintances, in whom she confided her secret,
bubbling over with pride as she told it. They congratulated
her and passed on, probably not giving the subject
another thought. Hannah Browne had always been
ambitious, and her tale of a rich husband was received
with disbelief. Nevertheless, those casual meetings on
Christmas Eve proved of more than ordinary interest
some three months later. She had already intimated
to her brother that James Greenacre was to be her husband,
and the grocer had met his future brother-in-law
once. Greenacre, however, was in a far better position
than Gay, and did not trouble to cultivate his acquaintance.
On his part, Gay was only too pleased to learn
that some one was willing to take his sister off his
hands, and he felt indebted to Greenacre and did not
resent his indifference to him after their first meeting.</p>

<p>But something very important happened between the
fixing of the date of the ceremony and the dinner at
Carpenters Buildings, Camberwell, and that was the
discovery by Greenacre that Hannah Browne was actually
penniless. It came to him with all the force of a
knock-down blow, and he perspired as he thought how
near he had been to entering into a contract to provide
another man's daughter with board and lodging for life.
He trembled as he estimated how much that would have
cost him; but when his surprise and nervousness went a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
fierce hatred of the deceiver took possession of his small
and mean soul.</p>

<p>Hannah Browne had lied to him. She was penniless;
indeed, she had been compelled to borrow small sums of
money from casual acquaintances on the security of her
forthcoming marriage to him. The respectable grocer
and popular overseer went black with rage. His housekeeper,
who had contemplated the marriage with dismay
because it was certain that it would lead to the disinheritance
of her child, of whom her employer was the
father, fed his anger with the fuel of innuendo and jeers.
She blackened Hannah's character, declared that the
widow would make him the laughing-stock of Camberwell,
and, if he declined to marry her, would most likely
either try blackmail or sue him for damages.</p>

<p>The ambitious street-corner politician winced at the
prospect of the public ridicule her disclosures would earn
for him; the greedy grocer shrank from having to pay
out real red gold for breach of promise.</p>

<p>"She's coming to dinner to-night," whispered Sarah
Gale, the tight mouth and the small glittering eyes telling
their own story of insensate hatred of the woman who
had been selected to supplant her.</p>

<p>Greenacre looked into the face of his temptress, and
instantly realized that if he wanted an accomplice in any
crime here was one whom he could trust, even with his
life.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see her," he said, turning away from
the woman. "When she calls send her away. She'll
guess by that that I've found everything out."</p>

<p>"She will not go away quietly," said Sarah Gale.
"And if I give her a message like that she'll force her
way in. What'll the neighbours say if they find a
woman screaming outside your house on Christmas Eve?
Better let her in. You can give her a good talking to.
She deserves something for them lies she's been telling
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
He would have laughed to scorn the suggestion that
he was a criminal, if the accusation had been made at
that moment. Perhaps, he had been guilty in the past
of giving short weight to his customers, and now and then
in his anxiety to strike a bargain he may not have dealt
fairly with his friends, but these were venial sins, and he
believed himself to be a thoroughly respectable citizen;
yet greed of gold was going to turn him into a calculating
and cold-blooded criminal that very night.</p>

<p>When Hannah Browne arrived wearing her best clothes
she was admitted by Sarah Gale, who must have smiled
grimly when she saw the visitor's pleased expression.</p>

<p>The table was already prepared, and nothing remained
but to serve up the banquet. But Greenacre, who had
intended not to speak until after dinner, was unable to
restrain himself, and Hannah had not been two minutes
in the room when he burst into a torrent of angry words.</p>

<p>The widow started to her feet, listened for a few
moments in silence, and then laughed mockingly. Now
that the truth was known she only jeered at him, boasting
of her success in having thrown dust in his eyes for so
long. She answered him with threat for threat, and
swore that she would make him keep his promise to
marry her. Greenacre was provoked to madness, and,
losing control of himself, he picked up a rolling-pin, and
in a fury struck her with it. As she dropped to the
floor Sarah Gale stole into the room on tiptoe, and,
coming to the murderer's side, stood looking down at
the corpse, elated by the knowledge that Greenacre
would never be able to get rid of her now; in fact
would be in her power all his life. He could not speak
or move. The blood on the floor hypnotized him. He
was a murderer, and if he were caught he would be
hanged by the neck until he was dead. He shuddered
convulsively at the thought.</p>

<p>The woman touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why should anyone know?" she said, in a whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
that sounded like a croak. "Let us get rid of the body.
Hannah had no real friends. There'll be no one to
make awkward inquiries."</p>

<p>Her voice roused him and he pulled himself together.
The fear of the hangman was the greatest terror of all,
and now dread of the consequences transformed him
into a cunning, calculating villain.</p>

<p>With the help of Sarah Gale he divided the body
into three parts&mdash;head, trunk and legs. Each meant
a separate journey to a different part of London, for
he believed that if he hid the remains in three places
far apart from each other discovery and identification
would be impossible. One or possibly two of the ghastly
parcels might be unearthed, but it was out of the question
that all three would be found and put together. For
several hours the guilty couple laboured to remove
all traces of the crime, and Christmas Day dawned
with the parcels ready for disposal.</p>

<p>Wrapping the head in a silk handkerchief, he journeyed
by omnibus into the city; from there he went
to Stepney, and, reaching the Regent's Canal, he took
a walk along the bank until he came to a more than
usually deserted spot. Here he flung the head into
the water, taking care to retain the silk handkerchief,
for even in the hour of danger and stress he could
remember that it had cost him several shillings.</p>

<p>No murderer ever spent a more ghastly Christmas
than James Greenacre did, but he was by now quite
callous. The second journey enabled him to dispose
of the legs by flinging them into a ditch in Coldharbour
Lane, not very far from his house. The disposal of
the trunk, however, was the most difficult of all. It
made a very heavy parcel, and Greenacre, with extraordinary
daring, did not pack it in a box and attempt
to get rid of it that way. He wrapped it up in cloth
and paper, and, carrying it himself into the street,
found a passing carter, who gave him a lift until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
was a couple of miles from Camberwell. Then the
murderer took a cab, and, after two or three incidents
which would have unnerved most men, he reached a
lonely spot in Kilburn which he considered would make
an ideal hiding-place.</p>

<p>The threefold task completed he returned home quite
satisfied with himself. If the worst happened and the
three parcels were found, the finder of the trunk at
Kilburn would never dream of inquiring at Stepney for
the head, or at Camberwell for the legs. He argued that
the public would make three mysteries out of the three
parts and never think of associating all with one crime.</p>

<p>Greenacre began the new year with a feeling of relief
and security. His mistress, Sarah Gale, instead of
being able to hold a threat over him, found herself
compelled to keep silent for her own sake as well as his.
She was his accomplice, and, therefore, equally guilty
in the eyes of the law. Thus she had the best of reasons
for forgetting the Christmas Eve tragedy, and the respectable
grocer, quite unperturbed, went to reside
in another London suburb and continued to deal out
his "amalgamated candy" to the credulous and eloquently
describe its healing qualities.</p>

<p>Despite his first mistake, however, Greenacre had
not abandoned the idea of marriage, and he speculated
in an advertisement in the "Times," taking precautions
to disguise his real intentions. He advertised to the
effect that he required a partner with at least three
hundred pounds to help him to place on the market
a new washing-machine, of which he was the sole
inventor. Of course it was a lie. Greenacre wished
to get into correspondence with a woman of means,
and, in his opinion, this was the surest way, for any
female who answered his advertisement would possess
at least three hundred pounds, and the chances were
that the majority of correspondents would make a more
detailed reference to the means they possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
A lady with considerable savings did reply to the
advertisement, and Greenacre promptly changed his
letters from business communications into ardent
protestations of respect and admiration. Encouraged
by the lady's failure to resent the freedom of his language,
he boldly asked her to marry him, but, fortunately
for herself, she promptly rejected his offer.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, something had occurred elsewhere
which was to have a fatal result for the murderer.
On December 28th, 1836, the trunk of Hannah Browne's
body had been found at Kilburn. There was nothing
to identify it, and it was ordered to be preserved for a
certain time in case anyone with a missing friend or
relation should come forward and recognize it. The
only clue&mdash;and that a very tiny one&mdash;was that the
remains were wrapped in a blue cotton frock, which
had evidently been worn by a child.</p>

<p>Ten days afterwards a lock-keeper on the Regent's
Canal pulled the head of a woman out of the water.
A preliminary examination showed that it bore bruises
which must have been inflicted before death. The
most important discovery, however, was that the head
had been roughly sawn from the body. Now, the trunk
found at Kilburn bore similar traces of sawing, and that
drew the attention of the Stepney police to the coincidence.
They took the head to Kilburn, and there it
was seen that it fitted the trunk exactly. It was now
possible to have the body identified, but, although scores
of persons came and viewed the legless corpse, it remained
unnamed.</p>

<p>Two months were to pass before the body was to be
completed. A basket-maker was cutting osiers in
Coldharbour Lane when he saw a parcel floating in the
ditch at his feet. He recovered it and examined the
contents&mdash;two legs. These he conveyed to the police,
who immediately placed them in the mortuary where the
rest of Mrs. Browne's remains were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
In this way Greenacre's plans were confounded.
He had staked everything against the possibility of
the three parts ever finding their way into the same
room, but within three months of the crime the complete
body lay awaiting identification.</p>

<p>The police were not a highly-organized force in the
year that witnessed the death of William IV and the
accession of Queen Victoria. Out-of-date methods prevailed,
and the most celebrated of the detectives were
now old men, the remnants of a system that was soon
to be swept away. But the treble discovery aroused
the authorities. The mangled remains of the poor
woman were proof positive that there was a dangerous
beast at large in London, and the police concentrated
their efforts on the task of finding someone who could
identify the corpse, certain that once the woman's name
was known the arrest of her murderer would follow
speedily.</p>

<p>However, the days went, and failure seemed certain
when Gay, Hannah Browne's brother, called to view
the body. He had not seen his sister for over three
months, and he was getting anxious about her. At
first sight of the corpse he declared that it was his
sister's and that when he had last seen her she was going
to dine with James Greenacre on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>"Did she keep that appointment?" asked the
officer in charge of the case.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't," answered Gay. "At least, Mr.
Greenacre came to me late on Christmas Eve and said
that Hannah had not turned up. He explained that
she probably had been afraid to call and dine with him
because he had found her out in some lies."</p>

<p>"Then this Mr. Greenacre will be unable to help us
to trace her movements last Christmas Eve?" said
the detective.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said the brother of the murdered
woman. "He and Hannah quarrelled. He thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
she had a lot of money, and when he learnt that she
was penniless he told her he'd never see her again."</p>

<p>Gay's conduct hitherto had not been creditable.
He had accepted with complacence Greenacre's account
of his quarrel with his sister and had not troubled to
confirm it by a little independent investigation, and his
feeble excuse was that he was afraid that if he took
too much interest in Hannah she would insist on his
keeping her, and, as he found it difficult to provide for
his own and his family's wants, he did not wish to be
saddled with additional expense.</p>

<p>The detectives now turned their attention to James
Greenacre, and several interesting facts instantly came
to light. The people next door said that they had been
disturbed on Christmas Eve by the sound of a scuffle
in Greenacre's house, and the latter's unexpected removal
had caused some talk. Then the tenants who
had taken his old house had commented on the smell
of brimstone when first looking over it. In their
opinion it had been thoroughly fumigated, and this
was confirmed by a woman who had seen Mrs. Gale
giving the house a most drastic cleaning a few days
after Christmas, an unusual devotion to work which
had excited remarks.</p>

<p>There was no hurry on the part of the detectives
to arrest Greenacre. They believed that he did not
know that suspicion had fastened on him. His demeanour
was one of unruffled confidence, and the semi-public
life he led favoured those whose duty it was to shadow
him and rendered it easy for them to carry out their
instructions. But Greenacre was fully aware of their
designs on his liberty, and with considerable cleverness
he nearly succeeded in outwitting them, for the unruffled
grocer by day spent his nights preparing for
flight, and he was arrested only a few hours before he
was on the point of leaving England for America. He
had booked his passage, and already some of his luggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
was on board the ship, but it was quickly recovered
by the police, and a thorough examination was made
of his property.</p>

<p>The investigation produced a plentiful crop of clues.
Several incriminating articles were found, the principal
one being the missing part of the blue cotton frock
which had been used to cover the trunk of Hannah
Browne's body. In addition to this and other unmistakable
evidence, his sudden resolve to leave the country
told against him. He was not the man to realize
property at a heavy loss and decamp to America without
a very strong reason. It was proved that when he
had heard of the identification of the body of his victim
he had hastily sold his property and his business,
binding the purchasers to secrecy so that he might get
away unobserved.</p>

<p>Greenacre did not waste time in denying that he
was with Hannah Browne on the night she died. He
knew that the evidence against him was very strong,
and he thought it wiser to concoct a story of an accidental
death, due to horseplay&mdash;an explanation, which
was, of course, instantly rejected. Then he offered
another version, which made the woman's death the
result of an accidental blow by himself which was never
meant to be fatal. This admission gradually led up
to the truth, and then the whole story, as told here,
was disclosed.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature of Greenacre's conduct
after his arrest was his concern for the woman who
had been his mistress as well as his housekeeper. She
was the mother of his four-year-old son, but, hitherto,
Greenacre had treated neither with especial kindness,
and it was her arrest which developed his latent love
for her. When he was informed that she, too, had been
taken into custody and would be placed in the dock
with him to answer the capital charge, he swore that
she was entirely innocent. When he was disbelieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
he raved and carried on like a madman, expressing his
willingness to take all the blame for the crime if the
woman was set free; but the authorities were adamant.
On no consideration would they agree to release Sarah
Gale; the woman was held a prisoner; and when she
and Greenacre met again they stood side by side in the
dock.</p>

<p>The trial was one-sided, Greenacre's statement concerning
the death of Hannah Browne constituting, in
reality, a confession. The defence, such as it was,
struggled feebly to win the sympathies of the jury.
The male prisoner's alleged respectability was dwelt
upon by his counsel, who endeavoured to prove that
a man of his character and disposition could not have
been guilty of such a horrible crime. As Greenacre,
however, had admitted that he had dissected and disposed
of the body this plea was rejected, for only the
most hardened of criminals could have cut a human
body up and carted it in sections about London. In
the circumstances, he never had a chance of escaping,
and the verdict of the jury was everybody's opinion,
including that of the presiding judges, Tindal, Coleridge
and Coltman.</p>

<p>The woman was found guilty of murder, too, but
the law was satisfied with the execution of the actual
murderer, and Sarah Gale's punishment was transportation
beyond the seas for life. Undoubtedly she took
a very prominent part in the crime, and but for her
readiness to aid and abet Greenacre the latter would
not have murdered the woman who had tried to trick
him into marriage and paid for her failure with her life.</p>

<p>James Greenacre was executed publicly on May 2nd,
1837, and a contemporary account of the scene makes
it difficult to believe that thirty-one years were to pass
before such a spectacle became impossible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Old Bailey and every spot which could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>command a view of the spot were crowded to excess,"
wrote an anonymous journalist. "From the hour
of twelve on Monday night up to the moment the execution
took place, the Old Bailey presented one living
mass of human beings. Every house which commanded
a view of the spot was filled by well-dressed men and
women, who paid from five shillings to ten shillings
for a seat. A great number of gentlemen were admitted
within the walls of Newgate, by orders of the sheriffs,
anxious to witness the last moments of the convict.
During the whole of Monday night the area in front
of Newgate was a crowded scene of bustle and confusion,
and the public-houses and the coffee-shops were never
closed. The local officers connected with the watch
had plenty of business on their hands in consequence
of the thefts that were committed, and the broils and
pugilistic encounters of many a nocturnal adventurer.
Divers windows were broken and many heads felt the
force of a constable's truncheon. The language of the
vast multitude was vile in the highest degree, and
songs of a libidinous nature were chanted. At one
period of the night the mob bid open defiance to the
whole posse of watchmen and constables, and not
only rescued thieves, but broke the watch-house windows.
Vehicles of every description drove up in quick succession.
The passengers, seemingly having their
curiosity gratified by the gloomy aspect of the walls,
retired to make way for another train. Occasionally
a carriage full of gentlemen, and, we believe, in some
instances accompanied by ladies, mingled for a moment
amidst the eager crowd.... All who had procured
places in the windows commanding a view of the place
of execution made sure of their seats by occupying
them several hours before the dismal preparations
commenced. There was not at any time of the night
less than two thousand persons in the street. Several
persons remained all night clinging to the lamp-posts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The occupier of any house that had still a seat undisposed
of informed the public of the vacancy by announcing
the fact on large placards posted on the walls, and
forthwith the rush of competitors was greater than on
any former occasion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Inside the gaol the condemned man was being exhibited
to the curiosity-mongers who had sufficient
influence with the sheriffs to obtain the right to inspect
and torment the convict, and an hour before his death
Greenacre was cross-examined by an amateur theologian
and caused "great grief" to the company by hinting
that Christ was not divine.</p>

<p>The contemporary report continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The culprit having been pinioned, Mr. Cope handed
him over, with the death-warrant, to the sheriffs to
see execution done upon him. About five minutes
before eight the procession was formed and began to
move towards the gallows.... On his appearance
outside he was greeted with a storm of terrific yells
and hisses, mingled with groans, cheers and other
expressions of reproach, revenge, hatred and contumely....
As the body hung quivering in mortal
agonies, the eyes of the assembled thousands were
riveted upon the swaying corpse with a kind of satisfaction,
and all seemed pleased with the removal of
such a blood-stained murderer from the land."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the condemned cell Greenacre wrote a euphemistic
autobiography and "An Essay on the Human Mind"&mdash;both
these productions were added to the archives at
Newgate&mdash;and between outbursts of piety and blasphemy
he boasted of his popularity with the fair sex&mdash;he said
he had been married four times&mdash;and seemed to be
concerned for the future of Sarah Gale. She survived
him by fifty-one years, eventually dying in 1888 in
Australia, a venerable, white-haired matron who had
outlived her sins.</p>

<span class="subhead">CATHERINE WILSON</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Amongst</span> female poisoners Catherine Wilson
takes a leading place. She had an active
career as a professional murderess extending
to ten years, perhaps even longer than that, but we
do know that she committed murder in 1853, and she
was not brought to justice and executed until 1862.
A very long career, indeed, for a woman whose ignorance
was only equalled by her cunning, and whose gaunt
and unfavourable exterior was in keeping with a black
heart and a diseased brain.</p>

<p>The first time the public heard the name of this
poisoner was in the month of April, 1862, when she
stood in the dock in Marylebone Police Court, and
was charged with having attempted to murder a Mrs.
Connell by administering poison to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Connell had been living apart from her husband,
and, having found a lonely and companionless life
irksome to her, she began to long for a reconciliation
with the man who had wooed and won her not so many
years previously. Of course, to effect this it was necessary
to find a sympathetic woman who would be able
to approach Mr. Connell and delicately and tactfully
sound him as to his views regarding a reunion with his
wife. For some unexplained reason Mrs. Connell asked
Catherine Wilson to act as intermediary, and to prepare
her for the task Mrs. Connell invited the widow to have
tea with her. She opened her heart to her guest, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
not conceal the fact that she had a little money of her
own, and volunteered other information, while the
hard-faced creature with the eyes of a tigress sat opposite
and planned her death.</p>

<p>The conversation was abruptly ended by a cry of
pain from Mrs. Connell. She had not noticed that
although Mrs. Wilson was only a guest she had poured
out the last cup of tea for her, and she thought that
her illness was the result of worry and overstrain.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Wilson instantly became sympathetically
attentive. The hard eyes even moistened as
she helped Mrs. Connell upstairs and laid her gently
and tenderly on her bed. Then she ran off to the nearest
chemist's shop and brought back a bottle of medicine,
but when Mrs. Connell took some of it her sufferings
became intensified. Catherine Wilson soothingly
offered some more of the "medicine" she had brought
from the chemist's, and Mrs. Connell, writhing in her
agony, again tried to drink it, but spilt a little of it
on the bed-clothes. The "medicine" was so strong
that it actually burnt holes in the linen!</p>

<p>Mrs. Connell did not die, though she suffered a great
deal, and at one time nearly succumbed.</p>

<p>The matter was too serious to be allowed to rest,
and, as she had been told by Mrs. Wilson that it was
the chemist's fault for giving her such medicine, she
called on him for an explanation. The chemist,
astounded and angered by the charge, quickly proved
that the medicine he had sold was perfectly harmless,
and when the police were sent for he demonstrated
conclusively that if anything noxious had been added
to the contents of the bottle the only person who could
have done it was the woman who had conveyed it from
his shop to Mrs. Connell.</p>

<p>After that there was only one thing to do, and that
was to arrest Catherine Wilson, who had disappeared
a few days previously. Her flight was in itself almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
a confession, and for six weeks she managed to evade
the detectives who were searching for her, but by chance
she was recognized by an officer when he was off duty,
and he took her into custody.</p>

<p>After several appearances at the Marylebone Police
Court she was committed for trial, and, under close
supervision, she calmly awaited the day of the great
ordeal.</p>

<p>And while she is in prison we can trace her history
up to the spring of 1862.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of the summer of 1853 that
a widower of the name of Mawer advertised for a housekeeper.
He lived in the pleasant town of Boston, in
Lincolnshire, was prosperous, and he would have been
quite happy but for gout, an enemy with which he was
daily fighting, using as his principal weapon a poison&mdash;colchicum&mdash;which,
taken in small doses, is often prescribed
by doctors. In large quantities it is, of course,
fatal.</p>

<p>Catherine Wilson was one of the applicants for the
post, and she was successful in obtaining it. She called
herself a widow, and, perhaps, there had been a husband
once who may have been her first victim. Mr.
Mawer, however, thought her a respectable, hardworking
woman, and she certainly proved unremitting in her
attentions to him.</p>

<p>Within a few months they were intimate friends,
and the housekeeper was so assiduous and helpful
that Mr. Mawer's gout became much better. He told
Catherine Wilson that it was entirely due to her, and
to prove his gratitude he informed her that he had
drawn up a will bequeathing everything to her. It
was a fatal disclosure, for had he not disclosed to her
his testamentary dispositions there can be little doubt
but that he would have lived much longer than he did.
The poisoner began her fell work at once, tempted by
the prospect of gain, and as she had the poison already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
in the house there was no way of escape for the unfortunate
man.</p>

<p>In October, 1854, he died, poisoned with colchicum,
as the doctor discovered; but, as Mr. Mawer was known
to have used that poison to counteract the gout, no
suspicion was attached to the "heartbroken" housekeeper.</p>

<p>Mr. Mawer's fortune was not as large as the woman
had imagined it to be. Still, it amounted to a few
hundred pounds, and the murderess, who had good
reasons for not wishing to remain too long in Boston,
packed up and came to London.</p>

<p>She did not come alone, for when she took lodgings
at the house of a Mrs. Soames, at 27 Alfred Street,
Bedford Square, she was accompanied by a man of
the name of Dixon, whom she described as her husband.
And packed away in her trunk was a large packet of
colchicum, which had been left over after Mr. Mawer
had been disposed of. There was enough of the poison
to kill half a dozen persons. Perhaps if Mr. Dixon
had been aware of that he might not have been so
anxious to caress this human tigress.</p>

<p>But Catherine Wilson soon discovered that she had
very little use for Dixon. He did not make enough
money to please her, and when the last of Mr. Mawer's
legacy had been spent she began to look about her
for a fresh victim. Dixon was clearly in the way,
particularly so since that Saturday night when he had
returned home intoxicated and had struck her. The
wretched man had no money, and Wilson had grown
tired of him. Besides, their landlady, Mrs. Soames
was by now Wilson's intimate friend, and she had learned
that Mrs. Soames was by no means dependent on letting
lodgings and that she had moneyed relatives and friends.
Before she could attack Mrs. Soames it was necessary
Dixon should be removed.</p>

<p>One day Dixon was taken ill, a curious wasting illness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
accompanied by terrible pains in the chest. Wilson
hastened to assure everybody she knew that her "husband"
had always suffered from consumption, although,
as she had to confess, outwardly he appeared to be
very strong and healthy. After administering a few
small doses of colchicum the monster finished off with
a strong dose, and then the "widow" tearfully implored
the doctor not to cut her "dear one" up because during
his lifetime he had expressed a horror of that "indignity."</p>

<p>But the doctor would not give a death certificate
without a post-mortem examination, for, Mrs. Wilson
having insisted that the cause of Dixon's death was
galloping consumption, the medical man was curious.
His curiosity deepened when on opening the body he
found the lungs absolutely perfect. Consumption then
was not the reason. But what was? The doctors were
puzzled, yet in some extraordinary manner Catherine
Wilson wriggled out of danger, and Dixon was buried.
No one accused her, and even if the doctor had his
suspicions he never gave a hint of them.</p>

<p>The "widow" went about in mourning, and as she
was quite alone in the world now Mrs. Soames was
sweeter and more sympathetic than ever, and night
after night the two women sat in the cosy little room
Mrs. Wilson rented, and there exchanged confidences.
The poisoner had a long series of skilful lies ready to
impress her friend, but Mrs. Soames, who had nothing
to conceal, disclosed the story of her life, and added
particulars of her friends and relations.</p>

<p>When she told Mrs. Wilson after breakfast one morning
that she was going out to receive from her step-brother
a legacy which had been left her by an aunt
the poisoner once again experienced that irresistible
desire to take human life. But here there seemed to
be no reason why she should run the risk of committing
a cold-blooded crime. By killing Mrs. Soames she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
could not become possessed of her property, for the
landlady had children, and she also had several male
relatives who would have interfered at once had Mrs.
Soames died and made a comparative stranger her
sole heir.</p>

<p>Mrs. Soames was paid the money and returned home,
where her married daughter had tea ready for her.
They drank it alone, but as they were finishing Mrs.
Wilson came to the door and asked the landlady to
come upstairs with her. The request was complied
with at once.</p>

<p>What happened at the interview we can only conjecture.
Probably Mrs. Wilson first congratulated Mrs.
Soames on the receipt of the legacy. Then she may
have invited her to join her in a drink to her continued
prosperity. Whatever did happen it is certain that
from the time of that secret interview Mrs. Soames
was never the same woman again.</p>

<p>The landlady could not get up next morning at her
usual time. This was remarkable, because she was
noted for her early rising, and she was not happy unless
superintending the work of her house. Mrs. Wilson
was, of course, deeply concerned for her friend, and
she asked the daughter to be permitted to look after
her mother.</p>

<p>Without waiting for permission the depraved creature
appointed herself the only nurse, and she would not
allow anyone else to give the patient her medicines.
All the special food, too, passed through her hands,
and when compelled by sheer exhaustion to take a little
rest Wilson did not return to her own bedroom, but
snatched a couple of hours sleep in an arm-chair in Mrs.
Soames's room.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of her illness Mrs. Soames had
ceased to vomit, and was not suffering any pain. Catherine
Wilson pretended to be delighted, though really
she was puzzled by the marvellous recovery the landlady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
had made. By sheer luck she had managed to
resist the poison her "nurse" had been giving her.
Of course she did not suspect this, nor could she gather
from the concerned look on Wilson's face that the truth
was that the murderess of Mr. Mawer and Dixon was
going to give her a large dose of colchicum that very
day and kill her.</p>

<p>Bending over the patient, Wilson offered her another
dose of medicine, and the trusting woman took it with
gratitude, for she had told her "friend" that her recovery
was due to her nursing. But within a few minutes
the landlady was screaming in agony again, and an
hour later Catherine Wilson was silently weeping by
the window while the doctor, who had been summoned
in haste, announced that Mrs. Soames was dead.</p>

<p>The same doctor had attended Dixon, and although
the symptoms were similar in both cases he did not
suspect Catherine Wilson of murder. Mr. Whidburn&mdash;that
was his name&mdash;was studiously correct, and,
as in the case of Dixon, he refused to give a medical
certificate without a post-mortem examination. He
made the examination himself, and then certified that
death had occurred from natural causes. Mrs. Soames's
nearest relation received the certificate, and the murderess
was safe. She surprised the family, however,
by a demand for the payment of ten pounds which she
said her late landlady owed her, and when she adduced
proof in the shape of a signed promise to pay by Mrs.
Soames the money was handed over. Nothing was
said as to anything Mrs. Wilson may have owed Mrs.
Soames. Later it was known that she had borrowed
a fairly large sum from the kind-hearted landlady,
and it was suspected with good cause that the promissory
note for ten pounds was a forgery. But these
were of no importance when later the gravest of all
charges was made against the poisoner.</p>

<p>The death of Mrs. Soames resulted in another change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of address for Catherine Wilson, and she went some
distance away from Bedford Square, engaging rooms
in Loughborough Road, Brixton.</p>

<p>The poisoner was well off, and did not stint herself,
and it was assumed by her new acquaintance that the
late Mr. Wilson had dowered her with sufficient goods
to enable her to live independently of the world.</p>

<p>It may be noted here that a few weeks before the
death of Mrs. Soames, Wilson had spent nearly a fortnight
shopping with a friend from the North, Mrs.
Atkinson. One day Mrs. Atkinson had had the misfortune
to lose a purse containing fifty-one pounds.
It was a terrible blow, and Mrs. Wilson was so grieved
for her that she offered to lend her all the spare cash
she had. The offer was refused&mdash;as Wilson had known
it would be&mdash;and Mrs. Atkinson had returned home
without having breathed a word against her old friend.
But when Catherine Wilson came back after seeing
Mrs. Atkinson off from King's Cross she was in funds,
and the following day she made an extensive purchase
of clothes for herself. Picking the pocket of her best
friend was the smallest of sins to a woman who could
take human life without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Mrs. Atkinson to come to London
once a year, and generally during the month of October.
She and her husband lived in Kirkby Lonsdale, in
Cumberland. Mr. Atkinson was a tailor, while his
wife ran a millinery and dressmaking establishment
on her own account. Strict attention to business and
frugal living were the sources of the prosperity of the
Atkinsons, and, on her annual visits to London Mrs.
Atkinson never came provided with less than a hundred
pounds with which to buy stock. She carried the
notes concealed about her person, and, of course, her
severe loss in 1859 made her more careful than ever
when she came to London in the October of 1860.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atkinson's visit to the Metropolis was exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
well-timed from Wilson's point of view. All
the money she had obtained during the previous twelve
months had vanished, and she was behind with her
rent. Her new landlady, fiercely practical, was demanding
payment every day, and her affairs were so
bad that, beyond the paltry breakfast she extracted
from the landlady, she often saw no food during a
whole day. It would not have done to have disclosed
the true state of affairs to her friend from the North.
That might have frightened her away. She invited
her to stay with her, and then she told her landlady
that her prosperous friend would lend her the money
to pay all her debts. In the circumstances the landlady
was only too pleased to see Mrs. Atkinson in her
house. Mrs. Atkinson left Kirkby Lonsdale in perfect
health, and looking forward with zest to her stay in
London. A keen business woman, she, nevertheless,
knew how to combine business with pleasure, and,
having said good-bye to her husband, she departed
in excellent spirits. Mrs. Wilson met her at the terminus,
and after a substantial tea&mdash;for which, of course,
the visitor paid&mdash;they went by omnibus to Loughborough
Road, Brixton, and, as the landlady afterwards
testified, Mrs. Atkinson arrived there in the best
of health, light-hearted and jolly. She must have
been a sharp contrast to Catherine Wilson, whose
countenance was repulsive, and whose manner was the
secretive one of the poisoner.</p>

<p>The women went about everywhere together, Mrs.
Atkinson paying all expenses. On this occasion the
visitor had brought a hundred and ten pounds in notes
with her, for business had been good and her customers
were increasing. The hungry eyes of Catherine Wilson
gleamed at the sight of the notes, and her bony fingers
longed to clutch them. Every day saw the number
of notes grow gradually less as Mrs. Atkinson was buying
stock, and the poisoner knew that unless she hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
there would not be enough money left to make it worth
her while to add to her list of crimes.</p>

<p>On the fourth day Mr. Atkinson was busy in his shop
at Kirkby Lonsdale when a telegram was handed to
him. He read it anxiously&mdash;for telegrams were a
novelty&mdash;and nearly collapsed under the blow. The
message was from Loughborough Road, Brixton, London,
S.W., and it said that his wife was dangerously ill.
Flinging all business on one side the unhappy man
hastened to London, arriving only in time to watch her
die. She was unconscious when he entered the room,
and passed away without a word to him.</p>

<p>The broken-hearted husband was stunned by the
blow, and his poor wife's "friend" was prostrated.
Mrs. Wilson, he was informed, had taken to her bed
upon being informed of her dearest friend's death,
and her grief was so intense that she was with difficulty
induced to give a brief account of Mrs. Atkinson's
last day on earth.</p>

<p>The doctor assured Mr. Atkinson that no one could
be more surprised than he was at the fatal termination
of Mrs. Atkinson's illness. An extensive practice had
brought him into contact with death in many shapes,
but there was nothing like this in all his experience.
He advised a post-mortem examination to ascertain
the cause of death, and the husband of the murdered
woman seemed inclined to sanction that course when
Catherine Wilson came forward with a pathetic story
of a dying request from Mrs. Atkinson that she, her
best friend, would see to it that her body was not
"cut up."</p>

<p>In the most natural manner the poisoner told her
lie, and Mr. Atkinson, to whom every word of his wife
was sacred, withheld his approval, and no examination
took place.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Atkinson was well aware that his wife had
brought a hundred and ten pounds to London with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and he searched for the notes amongst her effects.
When he failed to discover a single one he turned to
Mrs. Wilson for an explanation. Had his wife paid
all the money away? It was most unlikely that she
had. But he was even more astounded when Mrs.
Wilson informed him that his wife had arrived in London
with only her return ticket and a few shillings.</p>

<p>"Didn't she write and tell you what happened?"
said the poisoner, who was dressed in black, and carried
a pocket handkerchief with which she dabbed her eyes
every other moment.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't get a single letter from her," said Mr.
Atkinson. "I was a bit surprised, but I thought she
was too busy to write."</p>

<p>Catherine Wilson knew this, for she had destroyed
two letters which Mrs. Atkinson had written to her
husband, the unfortunate woman having entrusted
them to her to post. She now pretended to fathom
the reason for Mrs. Atkinson's silence.</p>

<p>"She was so tender-hearted, Mr. Atkinson," she
said, with a catch in her voice, "that she wouldn't
tell you the bad news. I'm sorry to say that she was
robbed of all her money at Rugby."</p>

<p>"Rugby!" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson, in astonishment.
"What was she doing at Rugby? I don't
understand you."</p>

<p>"She was taken ill in the train," said the woman,
lying glibly, "and when it stopped at Rugby she got
out. Soon afterwards she became faint again, and
when she recovered she found she had been robbed.
Then she came on here and told me, and I've been
lending her money to get about. She was hoping the
money would be recovered before she had to tell you.
Oh, she was goodness itself, and I have lost my dearest
and only friend."</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, sobbing as though her heart
was breaking, and Mr. Atkinson, who had been seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
with a suspicion, engendered by a memory of the loss
of the purse containing fifty-one pounds the year before,
dismissed his thoughts as unfair to the woman who
was mourning so whole-heartedly over the loss of the
wife he loved. He did not dwell any longer on the
disappearance of the notes. After all, his wife was
dead, and all the money in the world could not bring
her back to him.</p>

<p>He journeyed home again, and Catherine Wilson
waited only for a week to go by before she paid her
debts, added to her wardrobe, and proudly exhibited
a diamond ring which she said Mr. Atkinson had given
her as a small token of his gratitude for her care of
his wife. It had been the property of the late Mrs.
Atkinson, but the poisoner had stolen it before the
body of her victim was cold.</p>

<p>It may well be asked how Catherine Wilson could
commit so many cold-blooded murders unchecked.
It seems to us that it ought to have been impossible
for a healthy woman to die in agony and yet be buried
without a coroner's inquest. But that is what happened
sixty-one years ago, and we must be thankful
that nowadays a person of the Catherine Wilson type
would have an extremely brief career.</p>

<p>The cases described do not comprise all her crimes.
There were two other persons she attacked with her
poisons who happily escaped with their lives, and there
was an old lady in Boston who died in such circumstances
that it is practically certain Catherine Wilson poisoned her.
She had been friendly with her, and her sudden death
benefited Wilson to the extent of over a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the woman who was arrested
for attempting to poison Mrs. Connell. The period
between committal for trial and the proceedings at
the Old Bailey was a protracted one, but the prisoner
maintained a sullen demeanour whilst under the care
of the prison authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Occasionally she protested her innocence, but she
was crafty enough not to say much, and when she
entered the dock at the Central Criminal Court she
was still a human enigma to all who had come in contact
with her.</p>

<p>That she appeared confident of a favourable verdict
was obvious, and it had to be admitted that whilst
the prosecution had plenty of surmise and suspicion
they had very little legal proof. The defence relied
almost entirely on the absence of motive and the fact
that no one had actually seen the prisoner place the
poison in Mrs. Connell's medicine. There were a great
many suspicious circumstances which the prosecution
rightly demanded an explanation of, but the prisoner's
counsel pointed out that his client must be assumed
to be innocent until her guilt was proved. It was no
part of his duty to incriminate her or assist the prosecution.
The judge summed up in a way which indicated
that in his opinion the prosecution had not established
beyond all doubt the guilt of the prisoner, and the jury,
realizing that if they made a mistake and sent an innocent
woman to the gallows they could not undo it,
decided to be on the safe side. They, therefore, returned
a verdict of "Not Guilty," and Catherine Wilson,
poisoner, forger and thief, left the dock with a smile
on her hard face and a glint of triumph in her eyes.</p>

<p>How she must have laughed in secret at her victory!
What fools she must have thought the twelve good
men and true were! Her character was vindicated,
and she was safe. She was to suffer a severe shock,
however.</p>

<p>A few days later an amiable-looking man stopped
her just as she was leaving her lodgings.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said politely, one hand in his pocket
wherein lay an important legal document, "but are
you Mrs. Catherine Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the poisoner, who feared no one after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
her Old Bailey triumph. "What do you want with
me?"</p>

<p>"I am a police officer," he answered, producing the
paper, "and I must ask you to accompany me to the
station. I have a warrant for your arrest on a charge
of murder."</p>

<p>"Murder?" she gasped, terrified for a moment.
Then she laughed. "Whose murder?" She might
well ask that question seeing that there were several
with which she could have been charged.</p>

<p>"That of Mrs. Soames, of 27 Alfred Street, Bedford
Square," he answered, glancing at the warrant.</p>

<p>The police had not been idle during that long remand
following the mysterious poisoning of Mrs. Connell.
They had delved completely into Catherine Wilson's
past, and when they had compiled a list of her crimes
the authorities decided that they would arrest her again
and charge her with Mrs. Soames's death. They could
have added others, but, knowing with whom they were
dealing, they thought it better to keep the cases of
Mr. Mawer and Mrs. Atkinson in reserve. Should her
first trial for murder result in acquittal they would
charge her with having caused the death of Mrs. Atkinson,
and so on, until they had removed this danger
to society.</p>

<p>But the prosecution made no mistake this time,
and Catherine Wilson was in the coils from the moment
she listened to the outline of the case against her at
the Police Court.</p>

<p>Further facts were brought forward at the Old Bailey,
and so skilfully did the authorities present their case
that when the jury returned their verdict of guilty, and
Mr. Justice Byles was passing sentence, he could say:
"The result upon my mind is that I have no more
doubt that you committed the crime than if I had seen
it committed with my own eyes."</p>

<p>With a smile of contempt the poisoner left the dock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and when she was led forth to die in public, and twenty
thousand persons watched her last moments, she
presented the same cool, sneering manner, absolutely
indifferent to her fate, quite unafraid of death, and
without a word of sorrow or repentance for her terrible
crimes.</p>

<span class="subhead">PIERRE VOIRBO</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">The</span> case of Pierre Voirbo, the murderer of
Désiré Bodasse, an old man who had been
his friend, is one of the most remarkable of
French crimes. It established the reputation of Macé,
the famous detective, who devoted a book to explaining
how he succeeded in tracing the murderer from the
first clue&mdash;a pair of human legs&mdash;to the last, when,
by a simple experiment, he located the very spot where
the murder had been committed. If Macé had not been
an exceedingly clever man Voirbo must have escaped,
for he took every precaution to cover up his tracks,
and was undoubtedly assisted by luck. But the strong
arm of the law triumphed in the end.</p>

<p>Voirbo was by trade a tailor, and by inclination a
devotee of pleasure. He worked when he felt inclined,
and if he could borrow or steal he preferred either as a
source of income to the small profits derived from the
making and repairing of clothes. He frequented low-class
cafés, and gambled whenever he could, and, in
addition, he had a pretty taste in wines. Yet for all
his laziness and dissipation it was often remarked that
Pierre Voirbo seemed never to be without money. He
neglected his work until customers became few and
far between, but he was never behindhand with his
rent, and he could afford to employ an old woman to
keep his rooms tidy.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when Voirbo thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
marriage. The hero of many conquests, he had not
really been attracted by the opposite sex until he met
a good-looking girl with a dowry of fifteen thousand
francs. Then he found the good looks and the dowry
irresistible attractions. He considered himself not
wanting in appearance and ability, though he was
actually below the medium height, had black hair
and eyes, and a thin, cruel mouth. Eyes and mouth
bore witness to his dissipation, but the girl evidently
was blinded by love, for she agreed to marry Voirbo.
When her parents were told they gave their consent
on the condition that the bridegroom-to-be brought
into the marriage settlements at least ten thousand
francs. Voirbo instantly expressed his ability to provide
that amount, and he was thereupon formally
acknowledged to be the girl's fiancé by her parents,
who did not know that, so far from being in possession
of ten thousand francs, the tailor owed many thousands
already, and had not a hundred francs to call his own.
Voirbo, however, believed that he would be able to
raise the money. Penury had sharpened his wits and
endowed him with self-confidence.</p>

<p>A vague idea now occurred to him of borrowing
the money, exhibiting it to the girl's parents, and then
returning it when he got his hands on his wife's <i>dot</i>.
It was a pretty scheme, but its weak point was that,
owing to his reputation, there was no one in the country
who would lend him a franc, and after a little consideration
he abandoned the scheme.</p>

<p>But he was determined to have the girl's marriage
<i>dot</i> no matter what the cost. Fifteen thousand francs
meant a fortune to him. It would last a long time,
and when it was gone it would be quite easy to desert
his bride, and seek another elsewhere. It was, indeed,
a pretty plan he conceived, though he knew that the
first obstacle&mdash;raising that sum of ten thousand francs&mdash;would
prove the most difficult of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Amongst his friends was an old man, Désiré Bodasse,
a worker in tapestry, who had been Voirbo's companion
in more than one midnight spree. Bodasse, however,
had never opened his purse to pay. It was Voirbo
who always paid for their food and drink, the spindle-legged
little man, with the dry cough, chuckling to
himself as he saw the young fool throw his money away.
Bodasse boasted that for every franc he spent he saved
three, and he naturally despised anyone who spent his
money on others. Voirbo, however, had taken a fancy
to Bodasse, and was very often seen in his society,
while everybody marvelled at the strange partnership
between two men who were so dissimilar.</p>

<p>It was to Désiré Bodasse that Voirbo went with the
story that he must raise ten thousand francs at once.
The younger man painted a glowing picture of the
wealth of his future wife exaggerating her fifteen
thousand francs until it became a <i>dot</i> four times as great.
Bodasse listened with a thin smile on his thinner face,
and when Voirbo's outburst was over congratulated
him sarcastically.</p>

<p>The tailor ignored the sarcasm, and, after a pause,
boldly asked Bodasse to lend him ten thousand francs.
He knew that the old fellow had that sum and more
in the box under his bed, for Bodasse had been saving
for years, and was a rich man, and, Voirbo argued,
the time had come when Bodasse could show that he
was not ungrateful for the entertainment he had enjoyed
for years at his expense.</p>

<p>The worker in tapestry, however, was not the man
to part with his money. It was all he lived for; it
was all he thought about; and in a few curt words
he gave Voirbo to understand that if his marriage
depended on the success of his application he had better
forget all about it at once. In short, he would not
lend him ten francs, much less ten thousand.</p>

<p>There was no one else to whom he could apply, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Bodasse's refusal filled Voirbo with dismay, but he
had to pretend to be indifferent after the first shock
of disappointment was over, and an hour later both
men appeared to have forgotten the incident when
they sat in a café and drank wine to one another's
health. But Voirbo's brain was on fire. He had regarded
the capture of the girl's fifteen thousand francs
as a certainty, and he could not bear to admit to himself
that he was going to lose her fortune after all. Where
could he raise ten thousand francs? Besides his ostensible
occupation of tailor he was one of the numerous agents
of the Paris secret police. He had used his official
position in the past to blackmail inoffensive citizens,
but he knew that it would take him more than a year
to raise ten thousand francs by that method.</p>

<p>Bodasse, unconscious of his companion's thoughts,
continued to drink at Voirbo's expense, while the latter
was rapidly summing up to himself the risks he would
have to run if he murdered the man sitting opposite
him. He knew all about Bodasse's life&mdash;the fellow's
miserly habits; his lack of friends because he had been
afraid that if he made many they might cost him money;
his unpopularity in the neighbourhood in which he
lived, and the well-known fact that his greatest wish
was to be left alone. Voirbo recalled, too, that Bodasse
was in the habit of disappearing from human sight for
weeks at a time, when he either shut himself up in his
room or went into the country. In the former case
he was wont to provide himself with sufficient food
to last out his spell of seclusion, and if letters came
they were pushed under his door so that he might not
be disturbed by having to open it. With murder in
his heart, Voirbo thought over this, and came to the
only possible conclusion&mdash;the murder of Désiré Bodasse
would be about the easiest crime to commit and
the chances of escape would favour him.</p>

<p>The bottle of wine finished, Voirbo suggested an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
adjournment to his rooms, where he had often provided
Bodasse with food. The old miser agreed with
alacrity, and shortly afterwards they were in an apartment
at the top of a high house. From outside the
murmur of traffic faintly reached their ears, and from
the stairs came occasional voices, but, for all that,
the two men were quite alone, and Bodasse was absolutely
at the mercy of the younger and stronger man.</p>

<p>The temptation was irresistible. Voirbo looked at
the small body and wizened face, the thin, scraggy
neck and the lustreless eyes. Life seemed to be half-way
out of his body already, and it would be easy to
let the other half out too. Bodasse was sitting with
his back towards Voirbo, who had risen and was walking
irresolutely about the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fellow found the courage to put his
thoughts into acts. A heavy flat-iron, such as tailors
use, was lying handy. He picked it up, poised it for
a moment, and then brought it down upon the old
man's head with a fearful crash, which sent him in a
heap on the floor. There he finished him by cutting
his throat. The first act in the drama was accomplished.</p>

<p>Until the murder was done Voirbo had not thought of
locking the door, but now he ran to it and turned the
key. There were at least a dozen persons in the building
at the time, for it was let out in apartments, but
Voirbo, with extraordinary self-possession, proceeded
to make arrangements for disposing of the body. He
could not carry it out as it was, and, therefore, like
many other murderers, he decided to divide it into
several pieces. The head is, of course, the most important
part of the body, because it is the easiest to
identify. Get rid of the head and identification is
rendered a hundred times more difficult. Voirbo gave
it his special attention, and he disposed of it by filling
the eyes and mouth with lead and dropping it into the
Seine. The rest of the body was carted away in pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
but on his second journey he had a very narrow escape,
and disaster would have resulted early on had he not
formed his plans with the utmost thoroughness. He
undoubtedly proved himself efficient in small matters
as well as in large, as his unexpected meeting with the
police showed.</p>

<p>With a hamper and a large parcel, both containing
portions of the murdered man's body, he left the house
one dark December night, with the intention of pitching
them into the Seine at a spot where there would be no
one to notice him. The hamper and the parcel were
heavy, cumbrous and conspicuous, but Voirbo knew
that on such a night there would be few pedestrians,
and any who noticed him would think that he had been
doing his Christmas shopping, and was taking the
Christmas dinner and some presents home to his family.
Owing to the weight of his double burden progress
was slow, but Voirbo was not nervous. Nobody gave
him a second glance, and he had the satisfaction of
meeting more than one late shopper carrying big parcels
too.</p>

<p>But just as he was congratulating himself on complete
success he was horrified to see two policemen
coming straight towards him. His legs trembled, and
for a moment he thought of dropping hamper and parcel
and taking to flight, but before he could make up his
mind the two officers of the law had stopped in front
of him, and one was actually resting a hand on the
hamper.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what's inside your parcels?"
said one of the policemen suspiciously.</p>

<p>There had been numerous robberies in the district
lately, and the police had received special instructions
to keep a sharp look out for midnight marauders. In
fact, these two officers were looking for a burglar or
a street robber. They never thought of aiming as
high as a murderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
With difficulty Voirbo found his voice.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't get a cab at the station, messieurs,"
he said, with a smile, "and so I've been compelled
to carry home my purchases. This parcel contains
two hams. You can feel how heavy it is! The hamper&mdash;see
the label. It arrived for me by train."</p>

<p>The officers examined the label on the hamper. It
apparently had been addressed at a distant suburb
and consigned to Paris. The label certainly looked
genuine enough, and the explanation of hams in the
parcel accounted for its unusual weight.</p>

<p>The policemen consulted in whispers. They had
been impressed by Voirbo's frankness, and eventually
they permitted him to pass on. Had they examined
the contents of either hamper or parcel they would
have been able to arrest there and then as cruel a murderer
as France has ever known. It was characteristic
of Voirbo's cleverness that he should have labelled
the hamper before emerging into the open with it.</p>

<p>Gradually he got rid of the rest of the body, the last
expedition being to the well of an apartment house
close by, where he left the legs of his victim.</p>

<p>As an agent of the secret police Voirbo was conversant
with police methods, and also had access to their offices.
He knew that he would be one of the first to hear if
the authorities had been advised of either Bodasse's
disappearance or the discovery of any portion of his
body. For some days after the crime he frequented
the police offices, and what he saw there convinced him
that he could never be brought to account for his crime.
Discovery was impossible, and he was quite safe.</p>

<p>But so thorough was he in his methods that he did
not stop at disposing of the body and robbing his victim.
It was necessary to make the people in the house where
Bodasse had lived believe that the old tapestry worker
was still alive, though invisible behind the locked door.
Accordingly, Voirbo, having filled his pockets with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Bodasse's savings&mdash;they amounted to about thirty
thousand francs, mainly in the form of Italian bonds
payable to bearer&mdash;proceeded to impersonate his
victim.</p>

<p>For days and nights after Bodasse was murdered
the woman who lived in the room underneath heard
footsteps over her and, well aware that Désiré Bodasse
never received visitors, told her friends that the old
man, though he had not been seen for some days, was
hiding in his room as usual. Whenever letters came
for him they were pushed under the door, and, of course,
opened and read by Voirbo. The murderer, however,
would not remain in the room all night, and when darkness
fell he left, having first placed a lighted candle
near the window so that anyone who looked up would
say that Bodasse was at home. Each candle burned
for three hours before spluttering feebly out.</p>

<p>Every night for a fortnight the lighted candle was
seen and commented on, and, furthermore, the shadow
of a man's head was occasionally seen across the blind.
The neighbours gossipped about him, telling one another
that Monsieur Bodasse was at home. No one expected
to see him in the flesh for weeks, for it was understood
that he had given way to one of his fits of solitude and
would resent a call.</p>

<p>Voirbo, confident, triumphant, careless, and revelling
in his own cleverness, went to his prospective father-in-law
and told him that he was now ready to produce
the ten thousand francs which he required as evidence
of his position. This promise he carried out, and,
the girl's <i>dot</i> being brought into the common fund, the
marriage was fixed to take place a few days later.</p>

<p>"My rich friend, Père Bodasse, will attend me," he
said proudly to the family into which he was marrying.
He spoke, of course, after the murder of the old man.
"He is a bit of a miser, but I expect a handsome present
from him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
They little knew he had already murdered and robbed
Bodasse.</p>

<p>The family, impressed by Voirbo's fortune, expressed
themselves as most anxious to make the acquaintance
of Monsieur Bodasse, and they were looking forward
to that honour when, on the day of the wedding, Voirbo
told them that Bodasse had meanly run off to the country
to avoid buying him a wedding present.</p>

<p>"He will not get himself a new coat, the old miser!"
he added in angry contempt. "And that is why he
is not here. He knows his clothes are too shabby.
I have spent much money on him in the past, but never
again."</p>

<p>It was, however, a small incident, and in no way
spoilt the happiness of all concerned. There was a
banquet at an hotel, and afterwards the married couple
left for a short honeymoon. They were not to return
to Voirbo's apartments, for he had given them up and
had taken a house elsewhere.</p>

<p>With his wife's fortune he had now over forty thousand
francs and the newly married couple set up housekeeping
on an ambitious scale, because Voirbo declared that he
could earn quite a large income from his trade, so,
when the honeymoon finished, realizing that it would
be risky to parade his prosperity, he settled down to
work. He had taken measures to conceal the stolen
property, and, secure and confident, he lived from day
to day, expecting that in time Bodasse's disappearance
would lead to an inquiry, but utterly fearless of the
consequences to himself. And all the time his young
and pretty girl-wife never suspected that there was
anything wrong.</p>

<p>The third week of that new year&mdash;1870&mdash;was drawing
to a close when Voirbo heard that the legs he had thrown
into the well belonging to the restaurant in the Rue
Princesse had been found. He received the news calmly,
and offered no comment until he was told that Macé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
then in charge of the police department of the quarter
where the remains had been discovered, was commissioned
to unravel the mystery. Now Voirbo knew Macé,
and had never had a good opinion of his ability.</p>

<p>"He'll never solve it," he said, with a laugh that
reflected his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>He felt that he was lucky not to have one of the leading
detectives on the case. He feared the proved, tried
men who had unravelled the dark mysteries of the
past. But as for Macé, well, he was young and inexperienced,
and Voirbo was prepared to make him a
present not only of the legs, but of the rest of the body,
if it could be found. Nevertheless, curiosity, mingled
with some anxiety, induced Voirbo to pay a visit to
Macé's office. He was, of course, able to stroll in whenever
he liked, because he was in the police service himself,
and, naturally, his interest in the mystery of the
Rue Princesse excited no suspicion. There was nothing
remarkable about his inquiries. All Paris was roused
by the discovery of the legs, and Voirbo was as anxious
as anyone to hear the latest news.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his first visit he was told the result
of the medical examination, and how he must have
grinned in secret when he was informed that two doctors,
experts in the art of identifying human remains, had
given it as their opinion that the legs belonged to a
woman. Their thinness, the size of the feet, and the
fact that they were clothed in stockings, gave rise to
this mistake, which caused the police to spend a long
time looking for the body of a woman.</p>

<p>The one clue they had was the letter "B" marked
between two crosses. That was all the detectives had
to go upon, and for days the police inquired if anyone
had missed a girl whose Christian or surname began
with B. And Pierre Voirbo continued to laugh at them!</p>

<p>Macé worked day and night on the mystery. During
the previous three months eighty-four women had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
reported as missing, and after the most careful examination
into each case the detective selected three as
being most likely to help in the solution of the puzzle.
Great was his amazement to discover all three alive
and well!</p>

<p>Meanwhile other parts of the body of Bodasse were
picked up, though, as Macé was searching for a woman,
all these parts were not assumed to belong to the legs.
Half a dozen mysteries seemed likely to be manufactured
out of one, when Macé had the good fortune to think
of submitting the legs to another expert. It was only
by chance that he did this, but when Dr. Tardieu unhesitatingly
affirmed the legs to be those of a man the
detective realized that he had been working on the
wrong lines altogether.</p>

<p>The fixing of the sex was a most important and
valuable matter, although even now the mystery seemed
quite unfathomable. Macé, however, was determined
that the murderer should be brought to justice. He
meant to devote all his time and ability to the task.</p>

<p>His first examination of the cloth in which the legs
had been wrapped before being cast into the well had
convinced him that the parcels had been made up by
a tailor. They bore certain marks, and the string used
as well as the cloth confirmed him in this opinion.
He started at the house in the Rue Princesse, making
diligent inquiries as to whether a tailor had ever resided
there, but was informed that a tailor had never been
one of the tenants. The detective was not satisfied,
and he got the old woman who acted as concierge to
chat to him about the tenants, past and present.</p>

<p>The woman, glad of an audience, entered into a
minute account of the habits of the scores of men and
women she had met in that house. Most men would
have been bored to distraction, and would have ended
the interview abruptly, but Macé listened patiently,
only interrupting when the old woman casually mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
a girl of the name of Dard, whose claim on fame
was that, although she was now on the variety stage,
she at one time lived in the house as a humble seamstress.</p>

<p>The detective looked up at the mention of the word
"seamstress." Here, then, was somebody who had
worked for a tailor. It was but a slight clue, yet it
might be worth something.</p>

<p>The old woman gabbled on.</p>

<p>"She gave me a lot of trouble, monsieur," she said,
in a croaking voice. "Some one was always bringing
her work, and their dirty boots meant that I had to
wash down the stairs after them. There was one man, too,
who always carried water from the well upstairs for her.
He used to spill it, making more work for me."</p>

<p>"What was the name of the man?" asked the officer
quietly.</p>

<p>The woman did not know; but before he left the
Rue Princesse the detective had established the facts,
that Pierre Voirbo was the man's name, and that he
had lived close by, and was a tailor by trade.</p>

<p>All trivial clues, and based on conjecture, but Macé
considered them worth his trouble. He felt that he
was getting on, and when he discovered that Pierre
Voirbo had had a friend named Bodasse&mdash;Mademoiselle
Dard told him this&mdash;who had not been seen for a long
time, he congratulated himself, recalling the initial
on the stocking.</p>

<p>But there yet remained the difficulty of identification.
Step by step he delved into Voirbo's life, and simultaneously
set going the inquiries that ended in the
finding of an old lady who was Bodasse's aunt. She
was instantly taken to the Morgue to view the stocking
with the initial on it, and, greatly to the delight of the
police, immediately identified it as belonging to her
nephew. She had the best of reasons for her statement,
for she had marked the stockings herself. It appeared
that, as Bodasse suffered from cold legs, he had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the upper part of a woman's stockings joined to the feet
of a man's socks. This accounted in a measure for
the mistake of the doctors who had certified the human
legs to be those of a woman.</p>

<p>The aunt said that she had not seen her nephew for
a month, but had not felt alarmed on this account.
She was used to his ways, and she illustrated them by
relating how once when Bodasse had been unwell he
had entered a hospital under a false name so that he
might receive care and attention free of cost to himself.</p>

<p>Madame, however, was of further use, as she was
able to describe the appearance of Bodasse's friend,
Pierre Voirbo. She gave information as to his habits,
and Macé quickly had the story of the marriage, the
ten thousand francs, the change of address, and all
else of importance that concerned Voirbo at his finger-ends.
There only remained now the task of proving
that Désiré Bodasse had disappeared on a certain date,
and the detective went to the apartment house where
Bodasse had lived.</p>

<p>Here he met with a most unexpected rebuff. The
concierge actually informed him that Monsieur Bodasse
was at home at that very moment! The night before
she had seen a light in his room, and had noticed his
shadow across the blind. If her word was doubted,
she added the indisputable evidence that that very
morning she had seen Bodasse in the street!</p>

<p>The witness was undeniably respectable, and Macé
had to accept her word, and, now that Bodasse was not
the victim, he had to pursue his investigations elsewhere;
but before he left he deposited a letter with the
concierge to be handed over to the old miser when he
returned.</p>

<p>But Macé never forgot Pierre Voirbo. The man
might be innocent, but there was suspicion enough
to justify his being kept in sight. Even if Bodasse
was not the man whose legs they had found in the well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
it was just possible that Voirbo had got rid of the miser
for the sake of his savings. For that reason he was
shadowed, and, when, after a long wait and no sign of
Bodasse's return, the police determined to break into
his room they discovered that whoever had inhabited
it recently it had not been the tenant, for a robbery
had taken place.</p>

<p>The mystery became complicated, and yet simpler.
Who was the mysterious person who had walked about
Bodasse's room, and who had come every night to light
the candle? The bed had not been slept in for weeks.
It was, therefore, obvious that the thief had not remained
there all night.</p>

<p>Macé had one answer only, and that was Pierre
Voirbo. The fellow had a very bad record, and his
association with the secret police did not earn for him
any prestige in the eyes of the law. He was a dissipated
loafer, ready to betray friend and foe alike, and Macé
was well aware that Voirbo was quite equal to murdering
Bodasse for much less than ten thousand francs.</p>

<p>Yet the detective hesitated and it was only after
tracing Italian securities belonging to the murdered man
to Voirbo's possession that Macé decided to arrest him.
Time had been lost in investigating certain clues suggested
by Voirbo himself, but there could be little
doubt now that they had been merely blinds to distract
suspicion from himself. Voirbo must have realized
that his position was growing worse every day. He had
begun by affecting to despise Macé, but by now he
knew that the young officer had proved himself to be
a past-master in the art of detection.</p>

<p>By a coincidence the very morning appointed by
Macé for Voirbo's arrest saw the suspected man walk
into the detective's office, apparently quite unconscious
of his fate. He had come, as usual, to offer his opinion
on the great mystery, and to accuse more innocent men.
Macé kept him waiting for half an hour, and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
eventually turned to speak to him Voirbo dropped a
card from his pocket-book. Macé picked it up for him,
and as he did so saw at a single glance that Voirbo
had booked a passage on a ship leaving France, and
had given a false name.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Voirbo was under arrest. He swore
that he was innocent, and reviled Macé horribly. But
the detective was unmoved, although there was much
to be accomplished before legal proof was forthcoming.</p>

<p>A visit was paid to Voirbo's wife, an innocent girl,
whose heart was broken when she learned the truth.
She produced the box where her and her husband's
marriage <i>dots</i> were kept. Macé opened it, and showed
that it was empty. He had robbed his wife as well
as Bodasse.</p>

<p>The officer, however, was determined to find the
securities Voirbo had stolen from Bodasse's room, and
he began a thorough search. When he reached the
cellar he found two casks of wine. A strict examination
of these revealed a piece of black string tied to a
bung above the head of one of the casks. Macé drew
it out, and at the end found a thin metal cylinder,
neatly soldered. Inside were the missing securities.</p>

<p>Another experiment remained. Voirbo was taken
by the police to the room where it was suspected the
crime had been committed. Here Macé had him forcibly
seated in a chair, and in his presence the detective
tested the slope of the floor by pouring water on it.
The water instantly dribbled towards the bed, finally
settling in a particular spot. The boards were taken
up, and congealed blood found.</p>

<p>Macé had argued that during the murder of Bodasse
much blood had been spilt, and that some of it must
have sunk between the boards at a point where the
slope had brought it to a standstill. Voirbo had washed
the top of the boards, but had forgotten to wash
underneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
This simple experiment had such an effect upon
Voirbo that he instantly confessed to the crime, telling
everything without reservation. He did not, however,
go to the guillotine, for before his trial, and after one
abortive attempt to escape, he cut his throat in prison.
The knife with which he took his own life was smuggled
into the gaol concealed in a loaf, and although Macé
strove valiantly to discover the person who had sent
it to Voirbo he never succeeded.</p>

<span class="subhead">EMANUEL BARTHÉLEMY</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Emanuel</span> Barthélemy was a villain of the
melodramatic type. Throughout his stormy
and adventurous life he appeared to be fully
conscious of the fact that he was acting a part. He
was theatrical in everything he did; yet the touch of
realism was seldom lacking, and he lived and died without
fear. He was tall, strongly-built, with a large head,
thick hair, an expressive cast of countenance; dark,
flashing eyes, and a mouth that was eloquent of the
villain's vile, savage temper. Barthélemy was a revolutionary
by profession, utterly unprincipled; killing
because he loved it as a sport, and the times in which he
lived provided him with numerous opportunities to
gratify his propensity for murder. His luck was extraordinary
until he ran counter to the English law, and,
although he escaped the death penalty once in England,
on the second occasion he stood his trial for murder
he was sentenced and executed.</p>

<p>Barthélemy was a Frenchman, and in the early part
of the nineteenth century he took part in many revolutions
in France. Louis XVIII, who had been restored
to his kingdom by the victory of Waterloo, was finding
it difficult to maintain his dynasty, and Barthélemy was
one of those who objected to his reign. His objection
took the extreme form of shooting dead an unfortunate
gendarme in cold blood. This was Barthélemy's first
big venture, and he was sentenced to the galleys for life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
as a punishment, being lucky to escape with his life.
But the murderer did not serve his sentence. In 1830
the political party he favoured succeeded in gaining the
upper-hand, and Barthélemy's callous crime was duly
considered to be a "political offence," and accordingly
he was released, along with thousands of genuine victims
of the ruthlessness of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a matter for much satisfaction and
enjoyment, and Barthélemy, nothing daunted, threw
himself into the fray again. He became a sort of
unofficial police spy, and for years haunted the cafés
where out-at-elbow politicians talked treason and other
things.</p>

<p>When a new Chief of Police was appointed the spy lost
his situation, and was compelled to join an active organization
which was opposed to the ambitions of Louis
Napoleon, but in 1848 there was again a revolution, and
Louis Napoleon became Napoleon III. The new emperor
treated his defeated opponents with ferocious
cruelty, and with hundreds of other refugees Barthélemy
fled to England to live in exile for the remainder of his
life.</p>

<p>From the moment of his arrival in London he took a
leading part in the counsels of the French colony. The
refugees never abandoned their hope that Napoleon III
would be driven from the throne of France. Day after
day in poverty they fed on hope and ambition, and
Barthélemy was ever the loudest and most swashbuckling
of the optimists. It was observed that he was never
without funds, although he came of a poor and humble
family, but he was so outspoken against the new order
of things in his native country that those who whispered
that he was a paid spy in Napoleon's service were
laughed to scorn.</p>

<p>In the course of time some of the refugees formed a
small colony near Englefield Green, Egham, Middlesex,
where they established a sort of country-house for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
more respectable of the French exiles&mdash;men who really
desired to serve their country, and who believed that
Napoleon III was ruining it.</p>

<p>By some means Barthélemy found his way into the
house at Egham, though his aggressive manner and
somewhat uncouth ways were abhorrent to the majority,
who were for the most part ex-officers of the French
Army and Navy. However, his whole-souled hatred
of the Emperor of the French was a passport to their
society, and they tolerated him until he became intolerable.</p>

<p>Barthélemy was by nature and instinct a bully, and
his favourite "argument" when anyone had the
temerity to persist in contradicting him was a blow
from his heavy fist. He had a powerful voice, too, and
few persons could talk louder and longer than he, but,
like all bullies, it was the easiest thing in the world for
him to lose his temper.</p>

<p>His readiness to murder on sight, however, made him
a hero in the eyes of the riff-raff amongst the refugees, but
the better class regarded him with distrust, and only put
up with his "eccentricities" because the movement
was short of men.</p>

<p>Amongst the colony at Egham there was an ex-naval
officer of the name of Cournet. He had served his
country well without enriching himself, and in character
and disposition he was the reverse of Barthélemy,
though Cournet, when provoked, was fierce and short-tempered.
Still, he was, as a rule, polite and courteous,
and he never originated a quarrel. The numerous
revolutions in France had involved him as principal in
no fewer than fourteen duels, and on every occasion he
had hit his man. He was, therefore, a duellist of renown,
and his reputation amongst the exiles was second to none.
Barthélemy did not like this, and he resolved to depose
Cournet from his leadership. To do this he had to force
a duel upon the ex-officer, and one night at Egham, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Cournet was in his mildest humour, Barthélemy sprang
to his feet and swore that the older man had grossly
insulted him. In the circumstances he considered that
Cournet ought to give him the "usual satisfaction one
gentleman owes to another," and that meant a duel.
But Barthélemy had forgotten one thing. He had
challenged Cournet, who, accordingly, had the right
to name the weapons. Now, Cournet was an expert with
the pistol, and Barthélemy considered himself equally
expert with the sword. As the challenged party, however,
Cournet selected pistols, and Barthélemy had to
abide by his choice.</p>

<p>The duel was fixed for the following day, and Barthélemy
passed a night of terror. He saw himself an easy
target for the ex-officer's pistol. In fact, he was perfectly
certain that he was going to his death, and he did not
want to die.</p>

<p>His partisans meanwhile published abroad amongst
the French colony in London the news of the quarrel.
It divided them into two camps, each clamorous for its
champion's superiority. Bets were made as to the
result, and at about the time the duel was to take place
a crowd of refugees assembled in Leicester Square to hear
the result, just as in the past the race for the Derby has
caused crowds to assemble outside the offices of sporting
papers to await the name of the winner.</p>

<p>The duel was to determine who was the unofficial
leader of the Frenchmen driven into exile by Napoleon
III. Cournet's friends, however, were never uneasy as
to the result. They knew that their man would and
must win, but, unfortunately for their principal, they
forgot to take measures to prevent his opponent fighting
unfairly. Barthélemy and his intimates actually tampered
with his pistol, the weapon which had won for
him fourteen similar contests. To lessen the chances
of discovery they arranged that Cournet's pistol should
go off the moment the trigger was touched, but not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the direction intended by its owner, and then when
Barthélemy presented his weapon at his opponent it
would misfire, proving that his pistol was defective too.
The misfiring, however, would not forfeit his turn to
shoot, and at the second attempt Barthélemy would
have no difficulty in making the pistol do his bidding.
These were the final arrangements, and they were
carried out without a single flaw.</p>

<p>The duellists assembled on Englefield Green, and
Cournet won the right to the first shot. To his astonishment
and anger the charge in his pistol exploded, and
the bullet went harmlessly into the air. The ex-officer
was not, however, afraid. He stood rigid whilst Barthélemy
levelled his weapon. It misfired, and Barthélemy
had to devote a little time to setting it right. Then
he remembered that the episode provided him with a
chance for a theatrical display. In the best manner
of the stage hero he offered to forego his shot if Cournet
would consent to continue the duel with swords. The
ex-officer instantly rejected the offer, pointing out that
if Barthélemy missed he would be entitled to another
shot, and then, he grimly added, he would not miss
again. Barthélemy knew quite well that his opponent
spoke only the barest truth, and without another moment's
delay he levelled his pistol and shot Cournet dead.</p>

<p>It was murder, and murder of the most brutal and
disgraceful type, but none of the seconds realized that.
From first to last they had treated the English law
against duelling with the utmost contempt, although
they knew that according to the law of the land they
were all murderers.</p>

<p>But they regarded themselves as a French colony
owning the laws of France only, and, leaving poor
Cournet lying stark and stiff, the seconds and Barthélemy
went off to London with the intention of celebrating
the victory in the Soho Cafés frequented by
their fellow-countrymen. However, they were not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
liberty for long, for at Waterloo Station they were met
by detectives who took them into custody.</p>

<p>That was in 1852, not many years after the abolition
of duelling in England, and, in the circumstances, it was
considered wiser by the authorities to place Barthélemy
only on trial for the murder of Cournet.</p>

<p>When the case came on at Kingston-on-Thames all
the facts mentioned above were cited by the prosecution.
It was clearly proved that the contest had not been a
duel at all, but a cold-blooded murder on the part of
the prisoner and his accomplices. The tampered pistols
were produced, and the whole of Barthélemy's villainy
laid bare; indeed, Counsel for the prosecution had the
easiest of tasks. When the jury retired there was
considerable surprise in Court, for no sensible person
having heard the evidence should have wished for time
to consider his verdict.</p>

<p>The Surrey jury, however, were evidently of opinion
that the case "wasn't so simple as it looked," and they
spent some time in their private room, eventually
returning to astound a packed Court by declaring their
verdict to be one of manslaughter. Of course, there
was no help for it, and instead of the scaffold Barthélemy
received a nominal sentence, and was free again shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>The verdict of the jury&mdash;which in plain language
meant that, in their opinion, the duel had been fairly
fought&mdash;greatly enhanced Barthélemy's reputation
amongst his countrymen. The better-disposed, however,
avoided him, but in the purlieus of Soho it was considered
an honour to stand the "hero" of Englefield Green a
drink, or, when funds permitted, to offer him dinner.
Barthélemy was undisputed king of the bullies now, and
he thoroughly enjoyed his triumph. For some months
he was lionized, and he did considerable entertaining
in return, providing plenty of food and wine, particularly
the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
It was said that his object was to make certain men
speak freely and without thinking, and it was remarkable
how well informed the Paris secret police were of the
movements and doings of the principal members of the
French colony in London about this time. But if
Barthélemy was suspected of being their agent there
was no proof against him, and the majority of those who
knew him unreservedly accepted him as a pure-minded
and high-souled patriot.</p>

<p>But gradually Barthélemy's funds ran out, and his
borrowing powers showed signs of appreciable decline.
The aggressive theatricalism of his manner remained,
and he began to be something of a lady-killer. But
most of the time he was vulgarly hard-up, and he detested
poverty.</p>

<p>Some time in the year 1854 he came into the life of a
tall, handsome girl who spoke French with an English
accent. Who this girl was has never been discovered.
She came on to the stage, as it were, with Barthélemy
to take part in a tragedy that was to cost the villain his
life, and when the drama was over she was never seen
again, although the police of half a dozen countries
devoted weeks to searching for her.</p>

<p>The girl was undoubtedly pretty, and she fell in love
with Barthélemy, and, according to him, she told him
a moving and pathetic story of neglect and ill-treatment
by her own father. Her father, she declared, was Mr.
George Moore, a well-to-do mineral water manufacturer,
who lived at 73, Warren Street, Fitzroy Square, in the
dull and dreary neighbourhood of Tottenham Court
Road. She said he had promised to make her a comfortable
allowance, but had failed to keep his word, and she
implored Barthélemy to see that justice was done her.</p>

<p>Whether the murderer's statement was an invention
or not we have no means of knowing, but he did call
on Mr. Moore, and he took the girl with him, and the
visit culminated in a terrible tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
When the servant opened the door to the visitors
she noticed that the lady wore a thick mantle and was
heavily veiled. They passed upstairs to Mr. Moore's
private room and were cordially received, for afterwards
three siphons of lemonade were found on a table with
three glasses. It may be mentioned that in addition
to Mr. Moore and his female servant the only other
resident in the house was a young grandchild of the
tenant's.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Mr. Moore and his visitors chatted
amicably&mdash;it was never known what passed between
them&mdash;Barthélemy gave his version, but he was, amongst
other things, a professional liar, and his word cannot
be accepted. Mr. Moore undoubtedly received them in
the friendliest manner, and he must have had a good
reason for doing so. Who was the mysterious girl
heavily veiled? What part did she take in the conversation
that led up to the double murder?</p>

<p>Barthélemy's version was that he politely requested
Mr. Moore to deal fairly by his own daughter, whom
he intended to make his wife. Of course, as is the
custom in France, the Frenchman pointed out that the
bride must have a dowry. It was essential to the success
of the matrimonial adventure that the wife should be
in a position to support her husband. In this case the
husband-to-be was the type that does not like work.</p>

<p>Perhaps Barthélemy's statement was true except in
one particular. The mysterious lady may not have
been the daughter of the manufacturer, but it is credible
that Barthélemy may have planned the whole affair in
order to blackmail Mr. Moore. No doubt he induced
the girl to pose as the injured daughter, and it is conceivable
that he coached her into acting the part of
the grief-stricken woman whose mother was betrayed
and deserted.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore listened to the demand for a settlement on
the girl who said she was his daughter and then curtly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
declined to pay a penny. Barthélemy threatened him
with loss of reputation and its twin, respectability.
What would his friends think of him? The older man
laughed contemptuously. He was not going to yield
to a pair of blackmailers, and he told them to clear out
of his house as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>All three by now would be on their feet, Barthélemy
and Mr. Moore face to face, the former's eyes flashing,
his pose theatrical; and the girl in the background
watching, her face hidden by the heavy folds of her
veil. The two men would be exchanging angry words,
their tempers rising every moment until it would seem
that they must be overheard by anybody in the street.
But the blackmailer did not wish matters to go as far as
that, and he suddenly ended the altercation by smashing
Mr. Moore's head in with a blow from a loaded stick.</p>

<p>The unfortunate merchant collapsed in a heap on the
floor, but he was by no means unconscious, and he
shouted for help until his servant realized that her
master was in danger. Throwing open the front door,
she screamed in terror until the whole street was roused.
A policeman came running towards her, and she gasped
out what she knew.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the murderer would not attempt
to leave by the front door, and as the only other means
of exit was by way of the backyard and over certain walls
the officer&mdash;Collard by name&mdash;who had served in the
army and was a very brave man, without thinking of
the risk or waiting for assistance, dashed round to the
back of the house to intercept the Frenchman and his
female companion. A small crowd guarded the front
of the building, all of them valiantly prepared to take
any risk because there were fifty of them to share it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Barthélemy, realizing that he had killed
Moore, and that the whole neighbourhood was roused,
sought desperately for a way of escape. In the crisis
he thought only of himself, and, without a word to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
girl, he rushed from the room, darted downstairs and
into the yard, climbed a wall at the back and jumped
over, to find himself in the arms of the policeman.</p>

<p>The two men rolled and struggled in the road, the
officer undismayed by Barthélemy's superiority in
height and strength. Collard more than held his own,
but Barthélemy, as in the case of his duel with Cournet,
was not going to fight fairly. He drew his pistol the
moment he was able to release one hand, and with the
greatest deliberation fired twice into the body of his
opponent.</p>

<p>There were several eye-witnesses of the crime, but
no one appears to have attempted to detain the murderer,
and Barthélemy would have got away if, just as Collard
had fallen back with a groan, more police had not arrived
on the scene. The Frenchman was speedily overcome
by them and disarmed.</p>

<p>It had been a breathlessly exciting time from beginning
to end, and it was not until Barthélemy was being taken
to prison that it occurred to his captors to search for
his female companion. She had not left the house
by the front door, for there had been some one on guard
there all the time, and now the police entered, expecting
to find her hiding in one of the rooms at the top. Every
possible exit was closed before the search began, but
despite the protracted efforts of the officers of the law
to locate her she was not found. In the room where
the interview with Mr. Moore had taken place they
discovered lying near the body of the murdered man a
woman's mantle, the very one which she had worn when
admitted by the servant, as the latter confirmed.</p>

<p>How had she escaped? If she had gone by the back
way she could not have failed to attract the attention
of the crowd which had assembled when Collard had
tackled Barthélemy. Besides it was almost impossible
for a girl to climb the wall unaided.</p>

<p>The authorities quickly discounted the theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
escape by the back, and in the end it was generally
believed that the girl had come prepared for the tragedy,
and that she had dressed herself in such a way that by
discarding her outer garment she would look absolutely
different from the person who had entered with Barthélemy.
She must, therefore, have slipped off her
cloak, and mingled with the crowd in the hall, unobserved
in the general excitement.</p>

<p>It was a most extraordinary feature of the case that
the girl was never seen again. Not a trace of her could
be found, and the united exertions of the English and
Continental police failed to furnish a clue to her identity.
It was conjectured that the girl had left England within
a dozen hours of Barthélemy's arrest. As the only
person who could have told the story of Mr. Moore's
murder and the reasons which led up to it, she would
have been a most valuable witness, but, as she did not
come forward, the tragedy remained enveloped in
mystery.</p>

<p>Collard, the brave policeman, was in a dying condition
when taken to the hospital, and as his end was approaching
it was deemed advisable that he should give his
version of the struggle in the presence of Barthélemy.
The prisoner was conveyed to the hospital where Collard,
barely conscious, denounced him as his assassin.</p>

<p>The Frenchman stood with arms folded, and steadily
surveyed Collard's face. It was merely a pose, of
course, but it was a carefully prepared one, for Barthélemy
never admitted that the unlucky officer had
any ground for disliking him! He described the firing
of his revolver as an accident, and declared that when a
man is trying to make his escape he is justified in using
any weapon to further his ends.</p>

<p>The policeman briefly told how he had tried to arrest
Barthélemy, and when the statement had been taken
down in writing and read over to the dying man Barthélemy
was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Collard died a couple of hours later, and when his
death was notified the authorities decided to place
Barthélemy on trial for the murder of the policeman,
and not for the crime of having killed Mr. Moore. The
reason for this was that no one except the girl who had
vanished had seen the murder of Mr. Moore, whereas
there were several persons who had been spectators of
the second murder.</p>

<p>The police now began to investigate Barthélemy's
life, and by the time the prisoner came to stand his trial
at the Old Bailey were certain that the motive for the
murder of Mr. Moore was robbery and nothing else.
The mineral water manufacturer was in the habit of
keeping a fairly large sum of money in the house, and
Barthélemy had evidently brought his female companion
with the object of using her as a bait to draw
Mr. Moore's attention away from himself. If the
merchant should become engrossed in the girl Barthélemy
would be able to slip out of the room unobserved and
commit the theft. This was what he intended should
happen, but apparently Mr. Moore's suspicions had been
unexpectedly aroused before Barthélemy could act,
and in a vain effort to save himself, and also to obtain
the plunder, Barthélemy had committed murder, only
to find himself compelled to take a second human life.
This was the official version of a tragic interview, but,
as it was based entirely on conjecture, it was not universally
accepted.</p>

<p>To say that Emanuel Barthélemy enjoyed his trial
for murder at the Old Bailey is not an exaggeration.
He revelled in the role of first villain in a piece which
drew all London. As the hero of the duel at Egham
and the subsequent trial at Kingston, he was already
something of a celebrity. His achievements in France
as a revolutionary were the subject of common gossip,
and that they did not belie the character of the man
was obvious from the attitude of studied bravado he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
maintained throughout the trial. He always referred
to the double murder as "the affair," and while he
politely expressed regret that "the affair" should have
caused inconvenience to the policeman Collard, yet
he could not in justice to himself, admit that there was
anything in his conduct deserving of censure. He
had only fired in self-defence, and no one ought to blame
him for that.</p>

<p>The decision of the authorities to make the murder
of Collard the only charge provided the defence with
their one chance. Counsel for the prisoner ingeniously
argued that at the worst Barthélemy had been guilty
of manslaughter only. He had fired at Collard with the
object of facilitating his escape. There had been no
quarrel between the prisoner and his victim; they were
perfect strangers, and the policeman's death was really
an accident, as Barthélemy had only intended to injure
him.</p>

<p>Barthélemy held his head high all through the trial,
and there was plenty of the "flashing eye" business
and gesture of contempt interludes to enliven the proceedings.
He took up the attitude of one who does not
fear death, and, considering that this was his third trial
for murder and that he had escaped twice, he had some
reason for assuming that he was not meant to die upon
the scaffold.</p>

<p>The Old Bailey jury, however, proved somewhat
more sophisticated than the Kingston jury, and, without
hesitation, they rejected the subtle theories of counsel
for the defence. The fact could never be obscured
that Collard had been murdered by Barthélemy, and
their immediate and unanimous verdict was that the
prisoner was guilty. The usual sentence of death
followed, and Barthélemy received it with a mocking
bow. He did not care, and he was not afraid.</p>

<p>He knew that there was no chance of a reprieve, and
while he awaited execution he conducted himself quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
giving no trouble to the prison authorities. He declared
himself an atheist and declined to receive a priest of
his own nationality. When the chaplain managed to
speak a few words of admonition he answered with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"I don't want God to save my soul. If there is a
God let him save my body by opening the prison doors.
That's all I ask."</p>

<p>As the time grew shorter, however, Barthélemy
became anxious about something, but it was not his
soul. Sending for the Governor he declared that the
only cause of uneasiness was a fear lest after his death
his clothes should be exhibited at Madame Tussaud's!
The Governor reassured him by promising him that
they would not, and once more the convict's mind was
at rest, and he faced eternity calmly.</p>

<p>Calcraft was the executioner, and Barthélemy made
his acquaintance with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>"I have one thing to ask of you&mdash;do it quickly,"
he said, on the morning of his execution, January 22nd,
1855.</p>

<p>The grim-visaged executioner nodded. Barthélemy
was undoubtedly a type of murderer not often met with
even by a man with Calcraft's experience.</p>

<p>When the Frenchman stepped on to the scaffold he
surveyed the crowd with a cool stare, slightly contemptuous
of their interest and excitement. In his opinion
death was not worth all this display. He was treating
it with the indifference it merited.</p>

<p>"Now I shall know the secret," he said, as the rope
was placed around his neck. A few minutes later he
was dead.</p>

<span class="subhead">WILLIAM PARSONS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">The</span> so-called "gentleman criminal" has flourished
in all ages and in all climes, and there
have been many remarkable scoundrels who
have utilized their social position to rob their fellows.
One of the most notorious was William Parsons, the
son of a baronet, and the nephew of a duchess, who was
educated at Eton, served as an officer both in the army
and navy, and, after a career during which he experimented
in every kind of fraud, ended on the gallows.</p>

<p>Parsons began early in life to plunder and swindle, and
his first victim was his own brother. When the two
boys set out for Eton each possessed a five-guinea piece,
given them by their aunt, the Duchess of Northumberland,
and when William had spent his he stole his
brother's. The theft was discovered, and the thief
received such a severe thrashing that he had to keep
to his bed for a fortnight. It was a punishment which
would have convinced most persons that "the way of
transgressors is hard," but Parsons quickly forgot when
the pain had gone and began to thieve again. The
head master of Eton received many complaints from
boys whose pockets had been picked. Gold and silver
watches and other jewellery disappeared as if by magic,
and despite the precautions taken to shadow Parsons
the thefts continued. He was thrashed again and
again, but all to no effect, and, finally, it was decided
to remove him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
He had an uncle living at Epsom, named Captain
Dutton, and to him he was sent. There was no publicity
about the "removal"&mdash;which was really expulsion&mdash;for
Sir William Parsons, the boy's father, was highly
esteemed, and everything was done to spare his feelings.
Captain Dutton received the young prodigal with much
kindness, generously ascribing his escapades at the great
public school to a boy's natural propensities for fun.
"Boys will be boys," said the officer, and prepared to
give his headstrong nephew the run of his house.</p>

<p>It was understood in the family that Parsons was
to inherit the estate of his uncle, who was by no means
a poor man. But Parsons was not one to wait for
dead men's shoes.</p>

<p>From the moment he arrived at Epsom he plunged
into every kind of vice. The gallant captain had an
account at a jeweller's, and Parsons, learning this,
ordered an immense quantity of plate, which he disposed
of in London for a tenth of its value. If any money
was left lying about the house the young thief's fingers
immediately closed round it. In vain his uncle censured
and forgave. Parsons was irreclaimable, and eventually
Captain Dutton kicked him into the street, and closed
his door against him for ever.</p>

<div id="ip_244" class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;"><img src="images/i_244fp.jpg" width="275" height="500" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">WILLIAM PARSONS</div></div>

<p>A family conference was now held, and it came to the
conclusion that Parsons had better be sent to sea, and
accordingly he took a voyage in H.M.S. <i>Drake</i> to the
West Indies, holding the rank of a midshipman. As
he was so well related, he was given a good time by his
fellow-officers, and although there were rumours concerning
him on board he managed to return home with
his name still on the books of the ship, and without
being in irons. This was, undoubtedly, a remarkable
accomplishment for him. But long before his return
he had decided that he did not care for the cramped life
of a sailor. He wanted to live in the very best style,
and have his fling in the gayest circles in London. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
had already acquired a fondness for gambling, and on
his arrival in England from the West Indies he took
all his savings to a gambling hell in London, and in a
few hours lost every penny.</p>

<p>He did not despair, for he was aware that there was an
idea in his family that he had reformed. His period
of service in the navy had convinced his relations that
he had indeed turned over a new leaf. The Duchess
of Northumberland was staying at her London mansion,
and Parsons, utterly penniless, paid her a visit, hoping
to induce his good-natured aunt to come to his financial
rescue. With apparent contrition he apologized for
the indiscretions of his youth, and swore that he now
found virtue more attractive than vice. It ended, of
course, in an appeal for funds, and the duchess handed
him five hundred pounds so that he might appear in
society as befitted his relationship to her. That night
the five hundred pounds became nearly two thousand
as the result of the most daring gambling on Parsons'
part. He took the most reckless chances, and every
time came out on top. He was naturally wildly delighted.
Here was the quickest and easiest road to
fortune, and he persuaded himself that in a few weeks
he would be worth many thousands of pounds. But
the sequel was absurdly conventional. Parson was
cleaned out within a couple of days.</p>

<p>Each time he became "dead broke" he called on the
Duchess of Northumberland, but with each succeeding
visit her presents of money became uncomfortably less,
and he had to supplement her grants in aid by purloining
various small articles of jewellery which he found on
her dressing-table. The duchess, however, possessed
so much jewellery that the thefts passed unnoticed
until one evening, whilst chatting confidentially with
her in her boudoir, he slipped into his pocket a miniature
set in gold, which her Grace valued highly&mdash;so highly,
indeed, that when she discovered her loss she offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
a reward of five hundred pounds for its recovery. It
was a purely sentimental valuation, but it placed
Parsons in a most awkward position. Five hundred
pounds would have been a godsend to him, and yet he
dared not surrender the miniature, for he was well aware
that his aunt would never forgive the theft, and, accordingly
the young thief was compelled to sell it to a jeweller
of doubtful reputation, who gave him fifty pounds for
it.</p>

<p>Having for the time being exhausted his resources in
London, Parsons was driven to the desperate expedient
of going home. The family seat was just outside the
town of Nottingham, but he found it so dull that he
became a regular frequenter of the assembly rooms at
Buxton. A few minor thefts provided funds for a week,
and the son of the well-known Nottinghamshire baronet
was received everywhere. No one thought of suspecting
him of being a thief, and when he stole a pair of shoes
with gold buckles, and disposed of the gold to a jeweller
in Nottingham, Sir William averted exposure when the
gold buckles were traced to his son by negotiating in
private with the original owner. For the sake of the
heart-broken father the victim of the theft did not
prosecute, and young Parsons was bundled off to London,
Sir William having no further use for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Parsons had not been saved from punishment
so often he would not have adopted crime as a
profession. But to a person of his temperament the
game must have appeared to be worth more than the
proverbial candle, because when he won he was paid,
and when he lost there was always a kind-hearted
relative or friend to pay for him. He was not at all
embarrassed by his narrow escape at Nottingham. It
was only a minor episode in a career in which he had
come unscathed out of many tight corners.</p>

<p>On his return to London he happened to meet a lady
some ten years older than himself, but whose burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of years was eased by the possession of a considerable
fortune. She was not bad-looking, and being without
near relatives she was an easy victim to the unscrupulous
fortune-hunter. When Parsons was introduced to her
as the son of Sir William Parsons, and the nephew of
the Duchess of Northumberland, the socially-ambitious
lady simply "threw herself at him."</p>

<p>She longed to shine in high society, and the moment
Parsons understood her weakness he played up to it
for all he was worth. He promised to introduce her to
his aunt, and swore that her Grace would instantly fall
in love with her and chaperon her, for, of course, anyone
who entered the charmed portals of society vouched for
by the Duchess of Northumberland would encounter
no difficulties in her way.</p>

<p>The lady accepted all his statements without demur,
but she proved somewhat coy whenever money was
mentioned, and Parsons had to ask her to marry him
before she would consent to advance him a portion of
her fortune.</p>

<p>They became engaged in secret, Parsons pointing
out that it must be kept quiet until he had time to
approach his aunt, the duchess, diplomatically and
break the news to her, for the lady was the daughter
of a man who had made his money in trade, and in those
days that was considered a bar to entry into society.
She was satisfied with his explanation, and she poured
thousands of pounds into her "lover's" keeping to hold
in trust for her. At the same time he was making love
to a girl whom he had met at his aunt's house, and he
actually bought her presents with the money he had
extracted from the too-confiding lady who fondly
imagined that she would soon be his wife.</p>

<p>When he had robbed her of every penny it was possible
to obtain without arousing the suspicions of her guardians,
Parsons, realizing that it would be better for his
health and comfort to vanish from London for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
months, returned to the navy and secured an appointment
on H.M.S. <i>Romney</i>.</p>

<p>There were a gallant set of officers on board, not too
well endowed with this world's goods, but quite willing
to hazard what they possessed at the gaming-table.
Well aware of this, Parsons, who deemed it only proper
to combine business with pleasure, took with him some
marked cards and loaded dice. Every evening the
officers played, and from the very beginning Parsons
won. Cynically contemptuous of the intelligence of
his opponents, he did not condescend to the usual trick
of allowing them to win now and then. He simply
took all he could get until it became painfully obvious
that the only man on board who never lost was William
Parsons, and it was generally agreed that there could
be only one reason for that.</p>

<p>The captain accordingly took Parsons aside and
informed him that they all had decided not to play
with him in future. The scoundrel shrugged his shoulders,
but, of course, had to accept the decision, for the
captain was the autocrat of the ship. But worse was
to follow, for before the voyage was at an end the officers
added to their first decision another one which prevented
anyone addressing Parsons except when duty compelled.</p>

<p>The studied contempt of his brother-officers did not
affect him. He had long since lost all sense of decency,
and his only anxiety was that there might be unnecessary
delay before he reached land again.</p>

<p>Once more he found himself in London, and determined
never to enter the navy again. The standard of honour
at sea was too high for him, and the blunt sailors had
a way of expressing their opinions which was decidedly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He plunged again into the life of a gambler, but with
all his experience could not win except on those rare
occasions when he was able to persuade the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
to play with the dice or cards he produced. Whenever
this occurred he swept the board, but he was by now
too well known, and it happened that it was only in the
semi-public gambling saloon where trickery was impossible
that he was allowed to play, because his fellow-gamblers
knew that the dice could not be loaded or
the cards marked.</p>

<p>One night he lost five thousand pounds to an army
officer, and as he had only fifteen hundred pounds on
him paid that amount on account. The officer, who
was somewhat the worse for drink, shortly afterwards
left the house, and Parsons followed him, robbed him
of the money, returned, and lost it again at cards. It
was a favourite trick of his to rob those he paid, and
the astonishing thing about it all is that he was never
detected.</p>

<p>Gamblers were fond of drinking and few of them
were sober by midnight. Parsons, however, kept his
wits about him, for he owed so much that he could not
afford to handicap himself as the others did. And yet
when he won a considerable sum he never had the sense
to stop. On three occasions his winnings exceeded
two thousand pounds, and within twenty-four hours
he was penniless again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he could live fairly comfortable on credit
as it was known that the Duchess of Northumberland
had named him for a large sum in her will, and it was
expected that her Grace's decease would free him from
all his liabilities.</p>

<p>Now, Parsons had been disinherited once&mdash;by his
uncle, Captain Dutton, of Epsom&mdash;and that ought to
have been a warning to him, but he never learned even
from his misfortunes, and he was destined to receive
nothing from his aunt.</p>

<p>It all came about owing to the sudden necessity for
him to pay a visit abroad. London was swarming with
his creditors, and to avoid them he went to Jamaica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
But money was scarce there, too, and he found the local
traders had a not unnatural preference for cash when it
came to bargaining, and Parsons accordingly forged a
letter, purporting to be signed by his aunt, guaranteeing
to be responsible for any sum up to seventy pounds
which her nephew might borrow.</p>

<p>When he had raised the sum mentioned, Parsons
decamped, and some time afterwards the duchess was
rendered furious by a demand from the Jamaican
merchant for repayment. She disowned the forgery at
once, and cut Parsons' name out of her will. She had
intended to bequeath him twenty-five thousand pounds,
and now she transferred the legacy to his sister, well
aware that her family would take every precaution to
prevent the "black sheep" touching any of it.</p>

<p>But the disinherited rascal was unperturbed, and it
seemed that he had checkmated misfortune when he
met and married within a very short time a young lady
with a fortune in her own right of twelve thousand
pounds, with more to come.</p>

<p>The newly-married couple set up in a luxuriously-furnished
house in Poland Street, in the West End of
London, and Parsons, anxious to obtain a better standing
in society, purchased a commission in a crack regiment.
He did not, however, lose his fondness for the gaming-tables,
and when his wife let him have four thousand
pounds he gaily informed her a fortnight afterwards
that he was without a penny. She came to the rescue
by allowing him to mortgage her securities, which he
did thoroughly, actually raising money twice on the
same documents.</p>

<p>Parsons had purchased a commission in the army
without any intention of ever doing any fighting, but
greatly to his annoyance his regiment was ordered to
Flanders, where there was every chance of his making
the acquaintance of powder and shot. His family were
delighted, hoping that active service would "steady"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
him. But the seasoned criminal disappointed them
again, and in Flanders he perpetrated frauds specially
suited to the situation he found himself in.</p>

<p>When it was necessary to reclothe the whole of his
regiment, Parsons was fortunate enough to secure the
contract, and on behalf of the regiment he bought a
great quantity of cloth. By some means he managed
to get it all to London, and there he disposed of it at
about half the rate he had bought it at, and in a few days
had spent all the money in riotous living.</p>

<p>This offence was, however, of too serious a nature to
pass unnoticed, and in due course it was reported to
the Commander-in-Chief. The Duke of Cumberland,
who was then the head of the British Army, dismissed
him from the service and confiscated the sum of money
he had paid for his commission, ordering it to be devoted
to replacing part of the losses sustained by his innumerable
frauds.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that more drastic measures were not
adopted, but no doubt the wealthy and powerful Northumberland
family brought all their influence to bear.
Besides, Sir William Parsons, the thief's father, was
well known in Court circles, and it may have been that
it was on his account that the career of his son was not
brought to a swift conclusion at the hands of the common
hangman.</p>

<p>Now that he was a cashiered officer he could no longer,
of course, associate with decent people. His companions
from henceforth were dishonest servants and
professional criminals. The lowest class gambling-houses
began to know him well, and he was addressed
affectionately by individuals who would not have been
tolerated by his father's domestics.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons had not unnaturally returned home to
her parents, who had informed her husband that if he
attempted to molest her they would shoot him like a
dog, and, as Parsons knew that there was no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
money to be had from her, he was only too glad to be
saved the trouble and expense of keeping her.</p>

<p>But he was not the man to live meanly, and he formed
many plans, the success of which would set him up
again as a gentleman of means and leisure. Every
decent door was closed against him, and he had to
depend now wholly and solely on fraud to provide him
with food and shelter.</p>

<p>Parsons took another house and furnished it entirely
on credit. The plate was massive and costly, and of
such value that the goldsmith who supplied it was the
first of the tradesmen to get anxious about the payment
of his account. But when, shortly after delivering it,
he nervously called at the house in Panton Square, he
was surprised to find it uninhabited. There was no
sign of life about it, and inquiries confirmed his impression
that the owner had gone away for a time. But
he could see that the furniture remained, and, therefore,
he was not greatly perturbed. The gentry were fond
of going into the country, and as Parsons had boasted
of his estate in Nottinghamshire the goldsmith returned
to his shop satisfied that he would be paid one day.</p>

<p>Other creditors rang at the front door, and failed to
gain admission, and when their suspicions were aroused
they kept a watch on the house, but they never caught
a glimpse of their debtor. Yet Parsons was actually
living there. He used to enter and leave by a small
door in the stable-yard, and he seldom went out unprovided
with a piece of plate or some other portable
article which was destined to find its way into a pawnbroker's
shop.</p>

<p>The comedy was brought to a sudden termination
by the impatience of the landlord, who was desirous
of seeing his rent. The law, which kept the other creditors
at bay, permitted him to force an entrance, but when
he did he discovered that he was too late. Parsons had
disposed of the furniture, leaving only the heavy curtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
to act&mdash;in every sense of the word&mdash;as a blind. The
creditors never received a single penny.</p>

<p>By now Parsons had a friend, a certain man named
Wilson, who had been a footman until dishonesty led
to his dismissal. Wilson had served for some years
in a family of position, and he had managed to pick up
some of their mannerisms, which he imagined justified
him in thinking that he could pose as a gentleman
himself. He was tall and good-looking, and could talk
glibly of several well-known personages as though they
were personal friends, whereas the truth was that he
had only waited on them.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this scoundrel, Parsons devised a
scheme whereby he would be able to recover some of the
twenty-five thousand pounds which he had lost by
the forgery of his aunt's name. The money was now
bound to come to his sister, who was generally referred
to as the "wealthy Miss Parsons," and, as at the time
we are speaking of marriage gave the husband instant
possession of his wife's fortune, Parsons suggested
that Wilson should carry off his sister, forcibly marry
her, and then pay over ten thousand pounds of his wife's
fortune to him.</p>

<p>It was a pretty idea, and the ex-footman entered
into it with enthusiasm. He knew that Miss Parsons'
entire fortune was considerably more than twenty-five
thousand pounds, and he would have paid double
William Parsons' commission if the latter had insisted
on more generous terms.</p>

<p>The preliminary plans were settled in an old public-house
in the Haymarket, not far from the lodgings
occupied by the girl, who did not suspect that her own
brother wished to sell her to a debased ruffian. Elopements
were common enough in those days, and the
forcible abduction of an heiress was considered legitimate
sport in certain circles. William knew his sister's
movements, and there seemed no reason to fear failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
when he bought over Miss Parsons' maid with a promise
to pay her five hundred pounds when the marriage
had taken place. The sum offered was an immense fortune
to a lady's maid, and she eagerly accepted the bribe.</p>

<p>All that remained now was to hire the coach and the
swiftest horses, arrange for the unscrupulous clergyman
to be ready at an out-of-the-way spot, and then to take
the unsuspecting girl to her doom.</p>

<p>From first to last Parsons exhibited much cunning in
this affair, and had it not been for the carelessness of
his confederate his plan might have succeeded.</p>

<p>But Wilson lost his head when Parsons persuaded
him to believe that marriage to his wealthy sister was
certain. The ex-footman could not keep his mouth
closed, and he drew attention to himself by his extravagant
purchases for the great event. He was buying
half a dozen expensive "ruffled shirts" in a West End
shop one day when, in the presence of several customers,
he boasted of his forthcoming marriage to "the great
heiress, Miss Parsons."</p>

<p>The small audience stared when they heard this, and
envied the well-dressed "gentleman" his good fortune,
but, unhappily for him, just as he was speaking a lady
had entered who knew him. She overheard his reference
to Miss Parsons, and she glanced at him with more than
ordinary interest. Great was her astonishment when
she recognized her ex-footman, Wilson, the man she
had discharged for dishonesty.</p>

<p>Steps were instantly taken to acquaint Miss Parsons
with the statements Wilson was making about her, and
she thought it prudent to change her lodgings, and to
hire an ex-pugilist to follow and protect her wherever
she went. But there was no danger from the moment
Wilson had made that very stupid and incautious remark
for the conspirators got frightened and separated,
though not before Parsons had savagely attacked
Wilson for his indiscretion. The result of the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
was the disfigurement of the footman's face for the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>Although he was now always short of ready money,
Parsons took good care to see that his wardrobe was
in first-rate condition. He never dressed shabbily,
always appearing as a man of fashion. London, however,
was not so remunerative as it had been: his
character was too well known, and the set he mixed
in was too poor to be worth the robbing. He, therefore,
decided on a sort of provincial tour, and he went down
to Bath with the intention of finding a vain and silly girl
with money, who would be attracted by his appearance
and his titled relations.</p>

<p>The baronet's son speedily found a victim in the
daughter of a well-to-do doctor. He represented himself
to be a bachelor&mdash;of course, the truth was that his wife
was still alive&mdash;anxious to marry and settle down in
quiet luxury, as befitted his birth. The girl readily
responded to his honeyed words, and in her father's
house the engagement took place, and was approved
of by the doctor, who had heard of Sir William Parsons,
Bart., of Nottingham.</p>

<p>Parsons began to borrow. In hundreds at first and
then in thousands, and very soon the girl's private fortune
of three thousand pounds, which she had inherited
from her mother, had been lent to Parsons, and lost by
him in the gaming-houses.</p>

<p>Her father advanced more, and when he had drained
the family dry Parsons announced that he was called
away to see his father to arrange for his marriage, and
he took his departure from Bath with the cordial good
wishes of the doctor and his daughter, who were destined
neither to see him nor their money again.</p>

<p>From Bath he went to Clifton. It was then a small
village where a few of the wealthy Bristol merchants
had country-houses. He arrived in the early summer,
and speedily got an introduction to a rich shipowner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
who had two daughters. Parsons discovered that the
two girls were wildly jealous of each other, and he
thereupon made each one the object of his attentions
without letting either know that she had a rival. There
was plenty of money in the family, but on the first
occasion Parsons delicately hinted that a loan of two
hundred pounds would be acceptable the hard-headed
old merchant only advised him to write to his father,
offering to bear the expense of the communication.</p>

<p>This was not what Parsons wanted, and he determined
to use the girls to extract the money from their father,
whom he termed "the old miser." Accordingly, he
took the elder girl out for a walk, and boldly explained
that he was temporarily without means owing to a
family lawsuit, and he hinted that if she wished to marry
him she must help to relieve his pecuniary embarrassment.
The girl promised to do her best, and, confident
that she would keep her promise not to divulge to her
father or sister what he had said, he met the younger
girl, and put his situation before her in similar terms.</p>

<p>A few days later he found that the two girls were
actually vying with one another as to which of them
could find the most money for her lover, unaware that
they were both referring to the same individual.</p>

<p>By some extraordinary means they got over five
thousand pounds for him, and Parsons supplemented
it with a forged order purporting to be signed by the
girl's father, ordering his manager to pay the bearer a
thousand pounds. Parsons presented the order in
person, received the money, packed his belongings, and
the same night left for London. When the fraud was
discovered the old man was for instant exposure, but
on reflection, and persuaded by his daughters, he decided
that the disgrace and ridicule that would follow for
them when Parsons was arrested was too big a price
to pay for revenge, and they never published the story
of their foolishness and gullibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
But Parsons' end was approaching. His good fortune
could not last for ever, and he met his match in a country
girl, who resented his advances after she had found him
with another woman and refused to act as his accomplice
in the passing of counterfeit banknotes. She denounced
him in a temper, and he was arrested. It was characteristic
of the fellow that when in prison awaiting trial he
should rob a fellow-prisoner of his small stock of cash.</p>

<p>For the offence of possessing imitation banknotes
Parsons was transported, but he managed to earn the
good graces of the governor of the colony whither he
was sent, and he was back again in England within two
years, paying the expenses of his journey by an audacious
robbery at the expense of the official who had sheltered
him in his house.</p>

<p>And now having tried nearly every variety and form
of crime, and being without funds, Parsons turned
highwayman as a last desperate resource.</p>

<p>It was the most precarious of all professions, but
there was ever the temptation of netting a large sum
of money. His first essay resulted in a gain of about
eighty pounds, and his second ten pounds less. The
money was not much use to Parsons, and he would have
abandoned the profession there and then had he not
heard that a certain nobleman intended to carry a
thousand pounds from London to a house a few miles
to the north of Turnham Green.</p>

<p>Parsons resolved to waylay the coach and capture
the money, but his plans were upset by his own arrest,
and after five months in prison at Newgate he was
executed on February 11th, 1750, the king rejecting
a petition presented to him by the prisoner's powerful
and influential relations.</p>

<span class="subhead">ADAM WORTH</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the American Civil War was going none
too well for the Northern States, President
Lincoln, who was determined not to introduce
conscription until he was absolutely compelled to,
offered a special bounty of one thousand dollars (about
£200) to every fit man who would volunteer to serve
"for the duration of the war." We all know now that
even the generous bounty failed to solve the recruiting
problem, and that conscription had eventually to be
resorted to, but for a time that thousand dollar offer
elicited numerous responses, and amongst the men it
brought into the army was a young clerk of the name of
Adam Worth.</p>

<p>Worth was just under twenty, smooth-tongued, clever,
self-willed, born to command, and, if physically small,
his muscles were as strong as fine steel, while the dark,
glittering eyes and the prominent nose were traces of
his German-Jewish ancestry. He received his thousand
dollars, donned the uniform of the Northern Army, and
then deserted, to re-enlist later in another regiment and
receive another bounty.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the greatest and most
successful criminal career the world has ever known.
In his school days Adam Worth had been cheated by
another and a bigger boy offering him a new penny for
two old ones. When the child was told of the loss he
had sustained he resolved he would never be "done"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
again, and he certainly recovered those two pennies
millions of times before he died.</p>

<p>Does crime pay? Those who really know are certain
that it does not, but there are a few who doubt. Well,
here is the story of a man who stole in all quite £500,000,
and who must have averaged close on twenty thousand
pounds a year during his active life. We shall see what
happened to him.</p>

<p>Satisfied for a while with the second bounty, Adam
Worth took part in several of the later battles of the
great Civil War. There is no record that he distinguished
himself, but, on the other hand, he performed
his duties satisfactorily, and participated in the rejoicings
which followed the triumph of the North. Along with
thousands of others, he was discharged from the army
when hostilities ceased, and as one of the men who had
fought for his country was assured of remunerative
employment. But Adam Worth's ideas of money were
too big to be honest, and he quickly drifted into the
society of thieves. He turned pickpocket, and achieved
some very neat thefts. Then he took part in a robbery
from a bank. He directed the operations, and their
success confirmed what most of his associates were
slowly realizing&mdash;that Adam Worth and success went
hand in hand. Gradually they began to treat him
with respect; afterwards they looked up to him as
their leader. New methods were needed, and Worth
supplied them.</p>

<p>"It's just as easy to steal a hundred thousand dollars
as a tenth of that sum," he said to his criminal associates.
"The risk is just as great. We'll, therefore, go out for
big money always."</p>

<div id="ip_260" class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;"><img src="images/i_260fp.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">ADAM WORTH</div></div>

<p>He introduced the system of utilizing the proceeds,
or part of them, of one robbery to help to bring off the
next. Hitherto the average thief was accustomed to
spend his ill-gotten gains in dissipation, and then look
about for a way of filling his empty pockets. Adam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Worth changed all that. He realized that crime must
be capitalized if it was to be successful and to pay large
dividends. One robbery, for example, brought in about
ten thousand dollars, and he distributed only half of
this amongst his followers, the balance being held in
reserve for another bank burglary, and the reserve was
frequently added to.</p>

<p>Worth's foresight was justified immediately. He had
despatched confederates all over the United States to
seek out likely banks to rob; and, when one of them
reported that the Boyston Bank, in Boston, was just
the thing they were looking for, Worth journeyed from
New York to inspect. He was delighted with what he
saw, for it seemed to him the bank was built purposely
for him. With proper care it would be the easiest job
of his life, and he saw to it that every care was taken to
ensure success.</p>

<p>Next door to the Boyston Bank was a barber's shop.
It did a good business, and had Worth not possessed
considerable monetary reserves he would never have
been able to induce the proprietor to sell out. The
crook, however, offered him a generous sum down "on
the nail," explaining that he was the representative of
a New York company which was going to introduce into
Boston a patent bitters which would sweep all other
patent bitters out of the market. The money and the
explanation were accepted, and within a few days the
necessary alterations had been made.</p>

<p>The shop window was packed with bottles&mdash;which
prevented anyone seeing into the shop&mdash;and a wooden
partition at the end of the shop effectively screened that
part from observation should a stray "customer"
appear. One of the gang, dressed as a shop assistant,
was always on view during the day, but at night he
assisted Adam Worth and two other men to dig a tunnel
under the shop and into the bank next door. For a
week they worked, taking particular care that no trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of their operations could be seen. The excavated earth
was carefully piled up behind the wooden partition and
watched as though it was gold. Thousands of Bostonians
passed the window of the New Patent Bitters Co.
unconscious of the fact that one of the most sensational
bank robberies of the century was being carried out,
for when the gang had finished their tunnel they entered
the vaults of the bank, broke open three safes, and
gathered a rich harvest of gold and silver and notes,
worth in all close on one million dollars.</p>

<p>The four burglars at once fled to New York, and there
they divided the spoils, later scattering when they
heard that the Boston police were after them. One of
the thieves went to Ireland, another to Canada,
Worth and the fourth member of the gang, Bullard,
sailed for England to open up a new and sensational
chapter in the story of crime.</p>

<p>Of course, they could not go by their own names.
Bullard called himself Charles Wells, and Adam Worth
took the name of Harry Raymond. He made it notorious
before he finished with it.</p>

<p>The two American crooks put up at one of the best
hotels in Liverpool, intending to take things lazily for a
few weeks, but Adam Worth's restless nature would not
permit him to keep his hands off other people's property
even when he was possessed of forty thousand pounds&mdash;his
share, after expenses had been paid, of the raid on
the bank at Boston. His confederate fell in love with
a barmaid at the hotel, and spent most of his time in her
company, leaving Worth to wander about the city, ever
on the look out for a likely crib to crack.</p>

<p>It was typical of the man that he should regard
Charles Bullard's love-making with contempt, because
it caused him to neglect business. Bullard could see
no reason why they should take any more risks until
their money was gone, but Worth looked upon crime
as a profession which must be pursued day after day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
no matter how large the profits. Anyhow, he left
Bullard to himself. Whenever possible Worth preferred
to work on his own, for that meant more for him.</p>

<p>At last he found what he wanted. There was a pawnbroker's
shop in one of the principal streets of the city
which, judging by its window display, must be bulging
with jewellery. Adam Worth decided to burgle it, and
to secure a wax impression of the key of the front door
he called three times within a fortnight to pawn certain
articles. He was disguised, of course, for he had to
engage the pawnbroker in conversation in order to
get an opportunity to press the bit of wax concealed
in his left palm against the key, which the pawnbroker
sometimes left lying on his counter. On the occasion
of his third visit Worth secured the right impression
and it cost the unfortunate tradesman twenty-five
thousand pounds, for that was the value of the goods
missing when he arrived at his establishment one
morning and found that it had been entered the
previous night.</p>

<p>Worth now decided to visit London. Liverpool was not
big enough for a man of his capacity, and, in addition,
he was growing rather tired of Bullard, who had married
the beautiful barmaid. He advised the newly-married
pair to make Paris their headquarters, and they took
his advice. Then Worth came to London and rented
a costly flat in the centre of Piccadilly. He had now
over sixty thousand pounds in hand, all of which he
devoted to his profession.</p>

<p>His flat became a regular meeting-place for all the
noted thieves of England and the Continent, as well
as those select crooks who came from America to interview
the greatest of them all. Worth had his own
staff of well-trained servants, all of whom could be
trusted, and with his large funds he was always in a
position to finance any big job. Thieves came to him
for advice and help. Was there a bank official to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
bribed or a skeleton key to be made? Adam Worth
solved both problems. Did a particular job require
the services of an expert burglar or forger? Adam
Worth had a large supply of either on hand. He knew
where to find the right man for every job, and in return
for his services he received a goodly percentage of the
profits.</p>

<p>The London police were amazed at the long series of
burglaries which began with Adam Worth's arrival
in London. Each one of them was carried out so neatly
that they were plainly the work of a master. But
who was the master? Could it be possible that the
American gentleman who lived such an open life in the
very centre of fashionable London was actually the
leader of a gang of burglars? If he was, surely one of
his gang would betray him? The police could obtain
no proof, and Adam Worth kept them so busy investigating
his depredations that they had very little time
to devote to his personality.</p>

<p>He planned the robbery of the French mail between
Boulogne and Folkestone that resulted in a loss to the
Post Office of thirty thousand pounds. Adam Worth
provided keys to fit the vans and the boxes containing
the registered parcels, and on another occasion actually
sent a couple of expert train thieves down to Dover
with an exact duplicate of the registered mail bag,
everything being on a par with the original, even to the
minute figures on the seal. That robbery brought in
about twenty thousand pounds, and it was only one
of many. Indeed, every case Adam Worth touched
turned to gold. Everybody who knew him regarded
him as their mascot, and his own personality did the
rest.</p>

<p>He was generous to his followers in good and bad
times. When any of them were down on their luck
they came to Worth, and were helped with presents
of money running into hundreds of pounds. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
way he bought them body and soul, keeping a register
of their names and abilities, and calling them up for
active service when he required them.</p>

<p>All this went on from that luxurious flat in Piccadilly.
Now and then Adam Worth took a trip abroad, intending
to rest, but he always came back to London with more
money than he had gone away with. It was quite
impossible for him to resist temptation.</p>

<p>Amongst Worth's most trusted followers was an
American, Charles Becker, the very greatest forger
who ever lived, not even excepting the famous "Jim
the Penman." Worth retained Becker as his principal
forger, and at his London headquarters the master
criminal got Becker and three other men together,
where a great campaign was planned. Coutts's Bank
was selected as the principal victim, and Becker, with
marvellous skill, forged a number of letters of credit
purporting to be issued by the London bank.</p>

<p>Worth supplied the four men with plenty of money
to begin their tour, advancing sufficient cash until they
could pass their letters of credit, when they would
return the money with interest. The gang got as far
as Smyrna without mishap, and all seemed to be going
well. But one evening when they were gambling at
their hotel they were pounced upon by the local police
and taken to prison. They had no chance at their
trial, and they were sentenced to seven years' penal
servitude, and lodged in a horrible prison at Constantinople
to serve their time. But Charles Becker, not
to mention the others, was too valuable to Adam Worth
to be allowed to pass seven long years in a Turkish
prison. Worth disappeared from Piccadilly for a time,
turning up in Constantinople in the guise of an American
millionaire making the grand tour. A few months
passed, and Adam Worth's friends were still on the worse
side of the prison walls, but the master-criminal was
only taking his own time to achieve success. Had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
hurried he might have bungled his plans. Turkish
officials are easy to bribe, but the right ones must be
selected, and everything must be done with dignified
slowness.</p>

<p>Worth had thousands of pounds in his trunk, and
these he distributed judiciously amongst the heads of
the police and the principal official of the prison.</p>

<p>When his task was completed he departed from
Constantinople, and the same evening three out of the
four members of his gang escaped from prison. The
fourth man happened to be weak and ill, and he could
not get away in time. The three convicts endured
many hardships following their escape. They had to
go into Asia in order to reach Europe by a roundabout
route, but while travelling through Asia Minor they
had the misfortune to fall into the hands of bandits, who
held them to ransom, although it was apparent that
they were penniless convicts. The brigands, however,
permitted one of them, Joe Elliott, to go to England
and communicate with their friends, and a month was
allowed for the payment of the ransoms. Of course,
Elliott went straight to Adam Worth's flat in Piccadilly,
and when he told his story Worth drew a cheque for a
couple of thousand pounds, and sent Elliott with the
cash to release his comrades. A few weeks later they
were all back in London again to take a "breather"
before resuming their attacks on the banks.</p>

<p>All this leads up to the theft of the famous Gainsborough
picture, "The Duchess of Devonshire," for
if Charles Becker had not escaped from the Turkish
prison the circumstances would not have arisen which
inspired Adam Worth to steal it. Becker, soon after
his return to London, forged a series of cheques, the
proceeds of which were taken to the Continent to be
exchanged for French and German banknotes. But
one of the men commissioned by Worth to act as his
agent in the disposal of the notes was arrested and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
brought back to England to face the serious charge of
forgery. This person, who passed under the name
of Thompson, was an intimate friend of his chiefs, and
Worth swore that he would get him released on bail
pending his trial. Of course, the American crook would
then have decamped, and if necessary Adam Worth
would have recompensed the man who went bail for
the money he would forfeit.</p>

<p>But the English law requires a householder of good
reputation to bail a prisoner, and Worth was not in a
position to command the services of one. There was
nothing to do but to see if he could not compel a wealthy
and well-known Londoner to bail out Thompson.</p>

<p>He was racking his brains for a way out of the impasse
when happening to be walking down Bond Street with
an English thief, Jack Phillips, known to his intimates
as "Junka" they were impeded by a crowd
of fashionable folk who were entering an art gallery.
The two thieves inquired what was the attraction
which had filled Bond Street with carriages, and they
were told that the famous Gainsborough was on view
in Messrs. Agnew's art gallery, they having bought it
a few days previously for the sum of ten thousand
guineas.</p>

<p>"Why, that's the very thing, Junka," whispered
Worth, with glittering eyes. "We'll steal the picture
and offer to return it to Agnew's if they will stand bail
for Thompson. They won't dare refuse, for they'll
realize that we could easily destroy the picture if they
did."</p>

<p>Phillips argued, for the plan struck him as preposterous,
but Worth insisted, and he brought Joe Elliott,
the man who had been captured with the other escaped
convicts by the Turkish bandits, into the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Three nights later there was a fog, and Phillips,
Elliott, and Worth went to Bond Street, where Phillips,
who was very tall, stood under the window of the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
where the picture was, and Adam Worth, who was small
and wiry, climbed on to his shoulders, and in a few
moments was in the gallery. It was the work of a
couple of minutes to cut the picture from its frame,
roll it up, and pass it down to Phillips, while Joe Elliott
kept guard fifty yards away to notify the movements
of the policeman on duty.</p>

<p>The programme was carried out without the slightest
hitch, and the next morning London and the world
was provided with one of its greatest sensations. That
was May 26, 1876, and despite the efforts of the best
brains of Scotland Yard, backed by a huge reward,
Messrs. Agnew did not see their valuable picture again
for twenty-six years. Then Adam Worth, a prematurely
aged man, broken in health and penniless, returned the
picture through the Pinkertons for part of the original
reward. He wanted the money to provide his two
children with a home and to ensure a little peace for
himself before he died.</p>

<p>But a great deal happened between that May morning
in 1876 and Adam Worth's sudden death in 1902. The
theft of the picture proved useless, because Thompson,
the prisoner, was released and allowed to leave the
country owing to a flaw in the indictment. He had
been extradited on the wrong charge and had, therefore,
to be set at liberty. When he heard this Worth
had the canvas concealed in the false bottom of a trunk
and taken to America, and during the ensuing quarter
of a century it rested in furniture depositories in Boston,
New York and Brooklyn. There it remained whilst
Adam Worth rose to the greatest heights a professional
criminal has ever reached, and there it was when he fell
into the depths.</p>

<p>Two years after the theft of the Gainsborough, Worth,
with several trusted followers, robbed the express train
between Calais and Paris of bonds worth thirty thousand
pounds. The money was needed, as by now Worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
had bought a beautiful steam yacht, which he called
the <i>Shamrock</i>, and in addition to maintaining it and a
crew of twenty men, he turned racehorse owner and
took out a licence to race in England. He was at his
zenith now, and hundreds of persons who met the well-dressed,
spruce little man with the engaging personality
never suspected for a moment that they were in the
presence of the King of Crooks.</p>

<p>Adam Worth adapted himself to any circumstances
that arose, but behind the smooth face there was an
evil soul, always planning attacks on society, always
on the lookout to thieve and burgle and forge. And
the stately yacht rode at anchor in the harbour at
Cowes, and its owner raced his horses, gave dinner-parties,
went to the opera, and lived the life of a man
whose wealth frees him from many of the sordid cares
of life.</p>

<p>The marvel of it is that it lasted as long as it did.
Adam Worth was always taking risks. Frequently he
would go for a pleasure trip in his yacht and every port
he touched had reason to regret the visit, for it meant
that some one lost thousands of pounds. Each visit
was celebrated with a burglary or a successful raid on a
local bank by means of a forged cheque.</p>

<p>His feats were many, and it is difficult to know which
of them to select here, for volumes could be written
about the master-criminal. On one occasion he was
carrying twenty thousand pounds' worth of diamonds&mdash;stolen,
of course&mdash;to America to sell, when a number
of thefts were committed on board the ship. Worth
was innocent, for he never stooped to robbing cabins,
but he was afraid lest he should be searched and his
stolen goods found upon him. He, therefore, left the
ship at the earliest possible moment, and boarded a train
for a distant part of America. But even then he left
nothing to chance, and he concealed his booty in the
carriage, deciding it was too dangerous to carry about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Sure enough he was arrested and, when he had proved
his innocence of complicity in the thefts aboard ship,
was released. Then he set to work to track down the
carriage in which he had hidden his diamonds, and after
some trouble found it in a siding. Late that night
he forced his way into the carriage, and recovered the
valuables. It is safe to say that not another thief in
the world would have carried out such a programme
so successfully.</p>

<p>But it was in the diamond fields of South Africa
that Adam Worth, alias, Harry Raymond, was at his
best. He was driven to visit Africa by the uncomfortable
fact that the English police were watching
him very closely; indeed, they had gone so far as to
place a detective outside his house day and night to
report every visitor. This was unbearable, and Worth,
who required more money, sent for an old friend, Charles
King, and together they travelled to Cape Town.</p>

<p>Worth was after a really big thing this time, and he
told his companion that he was not going to be satisfied
with anything under one hundred thousand pounds.
His first plan was to take what he wanted by simply
turning highwayman. He discovered that every week
a consignment of diamonds was sent from the De Beer
mines in a coach, which was driven by an armed Boer,
assisted by a guard. Along with King and another man,
Worth delivered the attack, but the old Boer driver
was not to be cowed, and he drove them off with his
rifle.</p>

<p>The failure of the plan sent King out of the country
in a panic, and the other man decamped too. But
Adam Worth was not dismayed. He knew that if he
persevered he must win in the long run, and now,
although he would have to act entirely on his own, he
became convinced that there was another and a better
way to rob the weekly parcel of valuable stones.</p>

<p>As has been described, the diamonds were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
from the mines to the Cape Town post office in a coach,
but they were not kept in the post office longer than it
took to make a note of the address, for every week the
steamer was waiting in the harbour to convey the
precious packet to England. It was, however, absolutely
necessary to the success of Worth's plans for that
parcel to remain at least one night in the post office in
Cape Town. How could he manage that? It was a
stiff problem to tackle.</p>

<p>He provided himself with the duplicates of the post
office keys, particularly of the safes in which the registered
letters were kept. This in itself was a great
achievement, but it would take too long to tell the full
story of how he ingratiated himself with the postmaster
and secured the wax impressions. That was only half
the work. It was more important that he should prevent
the coach reaching Cape Town in time for the steamer.
Worth went over the route taken by the coach, and he
was delighted to find a spot where it had to cross a deep
stream by means of a ferry. This was the crook's
opportunity. He hid in the neighbourhood until it
was dark, and then he cut the rope which held the ferry
to the bank. When the coach arrived from the diamond
fields the ferry had floated a long way down the stream,
and when it was recovered and the stream crossed the
driver must have known that only by a miracle could
he catch the mail that week. The miracle did not
happen, and the steamer had already sailed when the
coach arrived.</p>

<p>The parcel of diamonds had to be left in the safe
at the post office, to which Adam Worth had a perfect
key, and when he had first opened the safe he had
seen twenty thousands pounds' worth and more of
valuables, and had refused to touch them. What
was the use of twenty thousand pounds to a man who
wanted five times that amount, and who could obtain
it by waiting a few days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
The authorities did not regard the delay to the coach
as serious, and no extra guard was placed upon the safe
in which the parcel reposed, and at the proper time
Worth had only to enter the building, open the safe,
and take out a collection of diamonds worth a hundred
and fifty thousand pounds. It was a theft which can
be described as a masterpiece in its own line.</p>

<p>Once in possession of the diamonds Adam Worth
was in no hurry to convert them into cash. He knew
that everybody leaving the country would be under
suspicion, and so he trekked inland, posing as a merchant
in ostrich feathers. Before he left Cape Town he buried
the diamonds, and it was many weeks ere he and a
confederate&mdash;who came from America purposely to help
to smuggle the diamonds out of the country&mdash;returned
to recover them. When it was deemed safe Worth
and his friend took them to Australia and eventually
to England.</p>

<p>This "scoop" did not lessen Worth's appetite for
plunder. Other burglaries were quickly organized,
and Charles Becker was busily employed forging cheques
on banks in England and France. One of these resulted
in a friend of Worth's being arrested and convicted,
and Worth himself avenged his confederate by robbing
the banker who had given evidence of so much money
as to bring about his ruin.</p>

<p>But the day came when Adam Worth was caught.
He and another thief were robbing the registered mail
in Belgium when Worth's comrade made a stupid
mistake, and his chief was arrested. He received a sentence
of seven years' penal servitude, and he served the
time, although he was twice offered his freedom if he
would reveal the whereabouts of the Gainsborough
he had stolen several years previously. Worth, however,
would not trust the word of those who made the
offers, and it was not until he emerged from prison,
wrecked in health and financially crippled, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
turned to the Pinkertons, the famous American detective
agency, and consented on terms to surrender the famous
painting.</p>

<p>He was then approaching the sixties, and there can
be no doubt that he had lost his nerve. For nearly
forty years he had warred against society with only one
defeat, but that defeat finished him. With the money
the Agnews paid for the return of the picture, "Little
Adam "&mdash;as he was affectionately known to his friends&mdash;provided
his family with a home.</p>

<p>All his life he had been devoted to his relatives, and
he worshipped his wife and children. They never
knew that he was a professional criminal, and even
to-day they are unaware of the real character of the
husband and parent beside whose grave they mourned
nineteen years ago.</p>

<p>Adam Worth had his good points, for his motto was
that thieves should be honest amongst themselves.
He never resorted to violence, and he never betrayed
a friend, and we know that he was good to his family
according to his own lights. He was a danger to society,
however, and all we can wonder at now is that he was
permitted to plunder it with impunity for so many
years. But genius will overcome any difficulty, and
the genius of Adam Worth was something which raise
his doings out of the commonplace.</p>

<p>Yet, when all is said and done, the King of Crooks
realized before he died that crime does not pay.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SECRET PRINCESS OF POSEN</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A pretty,</span> fair-haired girl, who looked not more
than eighteen, sat in a forlorn attitude in the
park near the Imperial Palace at Posen.
Passers-by glanced at her curiously, and whenever she
lifted her soft blue eyes they saw that they were wet
with tears. When a stranger paused as if to address
her the girl instantly froze, and there was something
about her small mouth that caused him to change his
mind.</p>

<p>Presently, however, a tall, elderly man of distinguished
appearance came strolling towards her, and simultaneously
the girl's tears began to fall faster than ever.
Sobs were choking her when he came opposite her, and
he would have had to be hard-hearted to have passed
on without noticing her. But Count Renenski, millionaire,
patriot and statesman, had a generous disposition,
and the sight of beauty in distress claimed his sympathy
at once. With a courteous bow he asked if he could be
of assistance, and the girl, surveying him through her
tears, made room for him on the seat. She was so timid
and frightened and appealing that she seemed like a
gazelle, and the count, a noted philanthropist, thought
he had never seen so dainty a vision.</p>

<p>"I am Count Renenski," he said kindly. "Won't
you let me help you? I do not suppose you have ever
heard of me before, but I think I can be of use."</p>

<p>She laid one small hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"You have a face that tells me I can trust you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
she murmured, her form still trembling, "and I will tell
you all, but first you must swear not to reveal what I
am going to say."</p>

<p>He gave the promise readily, his curiosity piqued by
her tragic manner of expressing herself.</p>

<p>"I feel safe with you," she whispered in a caressing
voice. "God has been good to me this morning. I
have found a friend, count. When I tell you that my
name is Anna Schnieder it will convey nothing to you,
because that is only the name I was given to conceal
my true position. I was comparatively happy until
two years ago. Until then I thought I was merely
the daughter of an honest shoemaker and his wife,
though I was puzzled that they were able to give me a
first-class education. Then I discovered that some one
was providing everything for me. Judge of my astonishment
when by accident I learned that that some one
was His Majesty the German Emperor."</p>

<p>The count stiffened perceptibly, and his eyes distended.
He was one of the leaders of the National Polish party
which demanded to be freed from the intolerable tyranny
of Germany. He had been one of the Polish aristocrats
who had refused to attend the Kaiser's receptions in
Posen, the capital of Prussian Poland, and he was keenly
interested in all that referred to the man he and his
countrymen loathed.</p>

<p>"Yes, go on," he said under his breath. "You
can confide in me. I never betray a trust."</p>

<p>"I am sure you never have," she said, giving him
another appealing glance. "But to proceed. I am
naturally quick-witted, and I was able to put two and
two together. I began to recall incidents of my childhood,
and after a while I got my foster-mother&mdash;for
that is all she is&mdash;to answer certain questions. Within
an hour I knew the truth. I, Anna Schnieder, was
in reality Her Royal Highness Princess Anna of Prussia,
the daughter of His Majesty the Emperor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Count Renenski started to his feet. Was the girl
fooling him? He sharply scrutinized her features,
but she bore it bravely. There was certainly something
aristocratic about her. He sank on to the seat again,
and indicated he was listening.</p>

<p>"The year before the Kaiser married the Kaiserin
he was in Posen"&mdash;the count ejaculated that he remembered
it&mdash;"and there he met and fell in love with
a Polish girl of the name of Vera Savanoff."</p>

<p>"The Savanoffs!" cried the count in amazement.
"Why, I knew the family well. And there was a girl
too&mdash;several girls, in fact. I have often wondered
what became of them. But proceed, mademoiselle,"
he added with a courteous inclination of the head. "I
will not interrupt you again."</p>

<p>Encouraged by his attention, the girl proceeded
to amplify her story. She told of a mysterious marriage
in a Polish church&mdash;long since destroyed&mdash;between
the then Prince William of Prussia and Vera Savanoff,
and how after the ceremony the girl had disappeared.
She had been taken to a castle in the Black Forest,
and there the Kaiser had visited her regularly for five
years. Then a child had been born, and that child was
christened Anna Schnieder. Meanwhile William had
married a Princess of the Blood Royal, and was the
father of a family, but no one suspected that in the
sight of God the Kaiser had only one legal wife, and
that she was Vera Savanoff. When after the birth of
her daughter poor Vera died mysteriously the Kaiser
suddenly lost all interest in his first romance, and Anna
hinted that William II connived at her death.</p>

<p>It was an amazing story, and would have been unbelievable
had she not produced proofs. The count
was still trying to understand it all when she thrust
into his hands a bundle of papers which she had carried
concealed under her blouse.</p>

<p>"These are some of the proofs," she said frankly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
"I know it is difficult to credit my story&mdash;sometimes
I can hardly believe it myself."</p>

<p>The papers included a certificate of marriage between
Prince William of Prussia and Vera Savanoff, signed
by the officiating priest, but without witnesses' signatures.
Another certificate showed when Anna Schnieder
had come into the world. But the most important
documents were two letters from the Crown Prince of
Germany couched in intimate terms. One of them
contained the sentence, "I am sorry Father treated
you so badly. Surely he must know it was not your
fault."</p>

<p>The letters completely convinced the count of the
genuineness of the fair damsel's amazing and romantic
story. He knew the handwriting of the Crown Prince
of Germany very well, for he had lately been in correspondence
on the subject of the treatment of Polish
conscripts in the Prussian Army. The prince, who
was then doing all he could to gain popularity, and so
weaken his father's position, had planned to win the
sympathies of the Poles by a pretence of affection for
them, and Count Renenski, as an influential aristocrat,
had been selected by him as the person most likely to
further his objects.</p>

<p>When he had once more reaffirmed his promise not
to reveal what she had told him, Anna consented to
accompany him to his residence. She hastily dried her
eyes, and her recovery was marvellously quick, for
she was all smiles five minutes later as they were leaving
the park. She had insisted upon the count taking
care of the papers for her.</p>

<p>"I am only a weak girl," she said with delightful
humility, "and when the Kaiser learns that I know
who I am he will set his agents to work to try to get hold
of my papers. But I am so happy now that I have
found a brave friend."</p>

<p>The count owned a magnificent castle in Posen, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
as he was a bachelor, his widowed sister kept house
for him. The lady received Anna graciously, and Anna
on her part was relieved to find that the count's relative
was a small, inoffensive creature, who evidently thought
that her brother could do no wrong. When she saw
him pay the utmost deference to the young lady he
regarded as a princess, she followed suit, and Anna
became a sort of uncrowned queen of the mansion.</p>

<p>It was not surprising that the count, who was over
sixty, should soon begin to feel tenderly disposed towards
his protegé. She was heart and soul a Pole, she told
him.</p>

<p>"I want to vindicate my mother's fair name," she
cried, "and she was a daughter of Poland, the land I
love."</p>

<p>When the count asked her to marry him she gave a
tearful consent, but only on the condition that when
she had the right to call him husband he would help her
to prove to the world that she was the legitimate daughter
of the German Emperor. Count Renenski willingly
agreed, because he saw in the affair a chance to discredit
the Kaiser.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the count should settle a sum
equivalent to fifty thousand pounds on his bride, and
he instructed his lawyers accordingly. He also gave
her jewellery worth thousands of pounds, much of it
family heirlooms, and he placed a thousand pounds to
her credit at a bank in Posen. He declared that the most
fascinating of sights was Anna in the act of drawing
a cheque, for she revelled in the unusual luxury, and
her joy was childlike and beautifully innocent and
infectious.</p>

<p>The wedding was fixed for the tenth of July, 1910,
and a week before Anna went to stay with a female
cousin of the count's at a house twenty miles from Posen.
It was arranged that they were not to meet again until
she arrived in the state carriage belonging to the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
at the ancient church where the ceremony was to be
performed.</p>

<p>But Count Renenski never saw her again. On the
eighth of July she told her hostess that she was going
to drive into Posen to do some shopping, and as the old
lady was indisposed she went alone. That night she
took train to a remote German village, and with her
travelled the family jewels of the Renenskis and the
sum of three thousand pounds, most of which she had
borrowed from the count's cousin.</p>

<p>It was some little time before the disappointed and
enraged nobleman would confess that he had been
swindled by as clever a German adventuress as had
ever appeared in Poland, but it is doubtful if he ever
learnt that Anna Schnieder had purposely planted
herself on that seat in the park to wait until he came
along, or that she had looked up his history and had
discovered amongst other things that he was in the
habit of taking a morning constitutional, and, knowing
how generous and impulsive he was, had invented a yarn
about an ill-treated Polish mother and a brutal German
father, and, as the count's hatred of the Kaiser was
common knowledge, she had not found it difficult to
fool him.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion that all the papers she had
shown him were forgeries, but, as a matter of fact, only
the certificates came under that head, for the letters
from the Crown Prince were genuine enough, though
the words he had used bore quite a different interpretation
to that which Renenski had given them. Anna
had been at one time a waitress in a certain Bonn beer-house
where she had made the acquaintance of the
Crown Prince, and had become one of his earliest friends.
He had taken her about the country, and had even
affronted Berlin society by appearing with her in a
box at the Apollo Theatre, and drawing attention to
both of them by shouting at the performers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
scandal had been reported to the Kaiser, who had ordered
Police-President von Jagow to make short work of Anna,
and the police had accordingly forcibly carried her
away from the hotel where she was stopping, and had
threatened her with imprisonment if ever she went
near the prince again.</p>

<p>Anna had, of course, written to the Crown Prince,
and he had in response sent her the two letters which
she found so useful in her career as a brazen-faced
adventuress. For the prince had regaled her with many
stories of his father's escapades in the days when the
present ex-Kaiser was a very young man, and Anna,
being clever and unscrupulous, had treasured up
memories of these anecdotes with a view to making
use of them later.</p>

<p>Count Renenski made a guarded complaint to Berlin,
and when the matter was referred back to Posen, and
the German Chief of Police there called upon him to
obtain fuller particulars, the count, having in the meantime
remembered that he had pledged his word in
writing to Anna that on their marriage he would start
an anti-Prussian campaign, thought it more discreet
to withdraw the charge, although by so doing he lost
the only chance he had of recovering the very valuable
Renenski family jewels.</p>

<p>By now Anna was at Homburg in the guise of a
wealthy German baroness who had just lost her husband.
She spent the count's money freely, and her jewellery
was the talk of the place. She certainly looked exquisitely
lovely in black, and her dainty youthfulness
made her a welcome addition to the society of the
famous German resort. It was impossible to imagine
for a moment that such an innocent-looking being
could utter a lie, and, as she had plenty of ready cash,
there was never any suspicion that she was an adventuress.</p>

<p>Men were such fools where a pretty face was concerned!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
How she laughed as she recalled the count's
love-making! But sometimes she sighed, too, because
she knew that he would have made a good husband.
Anna, however, had a husband already, a great, lumbering
person with an enormous appetite, who followed
the occupation of a brewer's drayman!</p>

<p>That was the reason why she had fled from Posen
before the marriage day. She had often had reason to
curse the mischance that had caused her when a village
maiden to accept Ernst Rippelmayer, but she had not
then known what she was capable of, and Rippelmayer
owned his own cottage, and was considered a safe and
steady man.</p>

<p>It happened that amongst the hotel guests was a
Colonel Bernstorff, a distant relative of the late German
Ambassador to the United States. He paid Anna
some attention, because, having only a small income, he
was desperately in need of financial reinforcements,
having wasted the fortune his first wife had brought
him.</p>

<p>In order to impress Anna, or the Baroness von Hotenfeld,
as she called herself, he pretended to be very well
off, and whenever she accompanied him to any entertainment
he spent money with the freedom of a man
who has more than he knows what to do with. They
soon proceeded from the formally polite stage to the
confidential, and before the Homburg season was over
it was understood that they were engaged.</p>

<p>For various reasons Colonel Bernstorff could not marry
at once, but it was agreed that six months later they
should become man and wife. This suited Anna all
right, and when she parted from him she went on to
Crefeld, where she intended to see if she could swindle
some of the officers of the garrison out of a big amount.
She wanted it badly, for she had been afraid to ask the
colonel for a loan, because she had no desire to give
him a chance to break their engagement. Bernstorff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
belonged to a well-known German family. He was a
member of several exclusive Berlin clubs, and he had
the entrée to the Royal Palaces. She knew that when
they were married she would be presented at Court,
and once that happened there was no reason why she
should not, with the secret aid of her old friend, the
Crown Prince, become quite a personage in society.</p>

<p>But meanwhile she must "raise the wind" somehow,
and so to Crefeld she went, where at the time a battalion
of the Prussian Guards was stationed. It included
amongst its officers several rich young noodles, and it
was to lay siege to the latter that Anna, with her most
fascinating gowns, started for the town.</p>

<p>She undoubtedly had an alluring manner, and shortly
after her arrival her apartments were frequented by
several of the officers. Anna, still maintaining her
bogus rank of baroness, provided all sorts of gambling
games, in which she declined to take part, declaring
that she had never played for money in her life. Occasionally
she would back the luck of a young officer,
and when he won she was rewarded with a pair of gloves
or some similar trifle. Anna would accept the gift
with as much gratitude and delight as though it were a
thousand guinea bracelet, but all the time she was
waiting to achieve her object. The officer she was
"shadowing" had just come of age, and she knew that
he had a large amount at his bankers which he was doing
his best to get rid of.</p>

<p>One night he lost all his ready money&mdash;a considerable
sum&mdash;and as he was anxious to go on Anna lent him a
thousand marks (fifty pounds) with which to continue.
But his luck was terrible, and eventually he rose from
the table thousands to the bad. It was nothing to him,
however, and after a touching interview with "adorable
Anna," as he called her, he was assisted to his carriage
by his servant. Next day he called and left a cheque
for the amount the impostor had lent him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
The adventuress had been waiting for this, and she
cleverly altered the carelessly-drawn cheque from a
thousand marks to one hundred thousand. It was
promptly honoured by the Berlin bank, and as soon as
Anna had the whole amount she prepared for flight.
But an hour before her train was due to leave she was
arrested at the station. The Berlin bank had on second
thoughts telegraphed to the officer asking for confirmation
of the cheque. He had replied denying that he
had recently drawn one for such a large amount, and
Anna's capture followed.</p>

<p>It was not very difficult for the police to find proof
of many of her swindles. She had imposed upon scores
of tradespeople, and had obtained a lot of money by
false pretences from elderly and infatuated Huns. A
very heavy indictment was presented against her, but
it was for the forgery of the cheque that the judge
sentenced her to three years' penal servitude.</p>

<p>Anna was stunned by her misadventure. She had
hitherto been so successful as an impostor that it seemed
as if she was immune from failure, but now she was a
convict, destined to pass three long years in a horrible
German prison, and when she heard that she was to
be sent to the women's convict establishment at West
Gradenz she nearly collapsed, for it was one of the worst,
the severe discipline frequently driving weak-minded
convicts insane. There was no appeal, however, and
one grey October morning she found herself handcuffed
to another convict, and passing through the gloomy
portals of the ghastly prison. It was a rule that each
new-comer should be inspected by the governor, and
Anna was in due course brought before that all-powerful
official, the man who was to have the power of life
and death over her until she had served her sentence.</p>

<p>She had been roughly thrust into a bare hall with
white-washed walls, and she was staring ferociously
at the hard earth floor when her companion whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that the governor was there. Then she started up, and
was petrified when she realized that the governor was
Colonel Bernstorff.</p>

<p>He recognized her instantly, but with admirable self-control
gave no sign. His appointment to this important
post had been unexpected, and he had striven to obtain
it so that he might be able to marry his fascinating sweetheart
at once. And now she was a convict in his charge!</p>

<p>He tried to ignore her, but somehow she had completely
won his heart, and a few days after her arrival
he made a pretext for seeing her alone in his office. By
now Anna, who had guessed that he would not be able
to resist her, had compiled a moving story of persecution
at the hands of her father, the Kaiser, and when the
governor asked for an explanation she confessed, amid
sobs, that she was the victim of a political intrigue.
Except for certain additions occasioned by the new situation,
it was the story she had duped Count Renenski with.</p>

<p>The governor was persuaded to believe her, despite
the fact that he had in the prison archives the papers
relating to her conviction, and he used all his family's
influence to get her a pardon. When this was granted
he married her, and, resigning his position, took her
for a long tour, Anna declaring that they need not
bother about money, as she would shortly receive a
million from her real father, the Kaiser. But the
honeymoon lasted only three weeks, for Anna was
arrested on a charge of bigamy, and it was only when
Colonel Bernstorff was confronted by her real husband
that he admitted he had made a fool of himself. He
thereupon abandoned the impostor to her fate, and
she was eventually sent back to complete her original
sentence, plus one of five years, for bigamy, and when
the war ended she was still in the gloomy prison of
West Gradenz.</p>
